Katrece T,Wasn't what I expected. Really enjoyed it. Including the hope for redemption at the end.,4.5,"Oct 8, 2023"
Chris L,A true feel good movie that I wish I saw in theaters. Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro have great chemistry and the movie tells a great story of 2 people generations apart growing closer and learning from each other. There is strong character development and a solid cast all around. I recommend it to anyone.,5.0,"Sep 26, 2023"
John A,All the pieces seem to be there except a truly appropriate third act. 'The intern' has chemistry-rich lead performances and a tenured auteur behind the camera.,2.5,"Sep 20, 2023"
Kevin M,"Brilliant movie! So warm, so satisfying and so moved! Recommend",4.0,"Sep 17, 2023"
Sean S,These two bonified great actors somehow have a great chemistry that truly makes this movie worth watching. It rushes the story along but that doesn't take away from the heartwarming affect it was going for.,3.0,"Sep 12, 2023"
michael p,The movie was very good! I can't believe what other critics are rating and saying about this movie. 2 legendary actors with a good script.,5.0,"Sep 8, 2023"
frederick c,"Good film overall, loved Robert de Niro, who fit the role really well. The story was pretty standard stuff however fun to watch and something to take away.",3.5,"Aug 13, 2023"
Fabrizio V,Very entertaining movie for when you just want to have a good time.,4.0,"Jul 29, 2023"
Shaun D,"I really enjoyed a lot of this. Thought De Niro really nailed his part, he was at the top of his game. Well worth a watch; although I wished a couple of the endings went a different way.",3.5,"Jul 23, 2023"
Brandon H,"A gentle film with low stakes and surface level lessons/values. Beautifully shot and well acted, but the story lacks depth. De Niro and Hathaway's mad acting skills manage to raise an otherwise boring film to very nearly interesting. Odd, that in all of Hathaway's meetings, she never one considered hiring a female CEO? Sadly, the successful entrepreneur will continue burning themself out because they cannot let go and struggle to delegate unless a flawless person who always says the right things magically shows up.",2.0,"Jul 14, 2023"
Alexsander F,"O filme até que é bom, bastante divertido. Mas o final não fez nenhum sentido, filme bem sessão da tarde mesmo.",3.5,"Jun 30, 2023"
Sergio L,"This movie was a good one to just throw on and enjoy, it's usually not my type of movie but I quite enjoyed the duo onscreen and the lessons you learn along the way.",3.5,"Jun 24, 2023"
GiGi H,"If you're looking for a feel-good film, this is it. A fantastic cast and a compelling story. We all know what it is to spread ourselves too thin and feel like an outsider. Learn something about work-life balance and how to fit in by being yourself.",5.0,"Jun 7, 2023"
Ravi T,"I came across this movie because I was looking for a wholesome movie that would make me regain some sort of faith in humanity. For the most part, this movie delivered. I'm not sure I agree with her decision in the end, but that was her decision I guess. Idk, the first half was very wholesome...but it got messy towards the end. But I guess that's life...messy.",4.0,"May 24, 2023"
Fanny M,"This is a terrible movie with an awful message. The only pro I give is the feminism behind showing that women can be on top but it is done in the most disgraceful way. Hathaway's character is out is control, clearly not able to handle a growing company, completely oblivious of tech (like not using email recall), and sinking it even more out of her power trip of not having a boss. A lot of shaming the new generation of men and glorifying the boomers. Extremely capitalist and pro destroying everything around you for your job. WTF with going to bars with employees (which you don't know their name because you are too ""powerful"") instead of going home and spend time with your family. The idea of feminism is to become better collectively and not for women to start acting like the stereotypical men. Also, sexual harrassment is out there like a joke...really? Is it ok because it is done to a guy?",1.0,"May 23, 2023"

Diogo G,This movie is one of the sweetest you'll ever watch! It has both the comedy and drama as well as a really sweet story. Overall it's an Awsome movie!,4.5,"Jan 23, 2023"
Chris H,"If you want to simply smile for 2 hours straight, go ahead and watch this movie. I have zero clue why anyone would rated this under 5 stars for a comedy/drama. The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is tremendous. I bought the whole thing and somehow there's actually a decent premise and storyline.",5.0,"Jan 11, 2023"
Rosie G,"Simple but sweet! I'd been having a terrible week where everything has gone wrong, and this movie was on TV in my hotel room and helped to distract me for a bit. I found myself smiling at some parts, and it was overall just a nice movie",5.0,"Jan 7, 2023"
Marcus T,"Deniro and Hathaway have good chemistry here, but the overall emotional tone is too mushy for me; feels manipulative. Deniro's character is too good to be true. Because he's Deniro he can almost get away with it. The messages about social and gender roles seem overly simplified and sort of muddy at the same time. Worth the attempt, but didn't quite pull it off",3.0,"Jan 4, 2023"
Brad A,Serviceable. Has a low-key feel to it. Something about it though brought me back to watch it again. So there is something to it... although i don't think it ever really hit the mark it was aiming for.,3.0,"Jan 3, 2023"

Mike J,"This movie makes people emotional and reminds us of why senior people are still very important in our society. Robert de niro makes such an amazing character that actually makes me feel calm to. Anne Hathway also makes an awsome character, power woman and rmaking a refrence to working moms which is a social issue today. The plot is good. It's a movie that makes you smile and laught a little.",4.0,"Sep 14, 2022"

Paul M,"I had chosen this movie because I am great Anne Hathaway fan. So obviously I was sure the movie was to be great. But when I watched it, I found the movie to be a fresh watch, something so subtle but touching with glimpses of laughs. The thing which touched the most was the story and the performances of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Specially that moment when they both work late night and he says he used to work at the same spot years ago. Must watch movie!",4.0,"Jan 22, 2022"
,This is a good movie. The story is good the music is beautiful. Robert de Niro plays a wonderful character. To watch,4.5,"Dec 25, 2021"
,"Less about what is said . . . more about how it is said. Simple story where the ending is apparent from the outset. The point is, with this film, in watching the plot unfold. Nothing deep. Nothing urging you to set a date to watch it again. Rather, more something about how people can feel. Interactions. We all know about what it takes to put a winning production together. Good writing. Good acting . . . and all the rest. This is no Gone With the Wind, it's just a show about . . . about people. Nothing more. And you wind up with a pleased smile. Pick your own person to identify with. I'm older, so DeNiro is for me. Taught me the value of keeping my mouth shut more often. Pays off. Perfect three stars.",3.0,"Dec 10, 2021"

,"A feel-good dramedy which, although drawn out in places, has its moments and is bound to make you smile.",3.5,"Aug 8, 2021"
,"I'm surprised the critics gave this one such poor ratings. Makes me wonder if they ever know how to enjoy a good movie. So, it's not original, so it raises a few issues that we may not agree on or whatever but this movie made me laugh, then cry, and in the end, it left me with a feeling of warmth. I enjoyed this so much. I used to watch movies based on critic's ratings but now I know better.",4.5,"Jul 4, 2021"
,A touching story with great actors.,4.0,"Jun 21, 2021"
,"Awesome. The script, the acting of the two leads, the story and how much you feel for the relationships, all very well done, except for Anders Holm acting. If Jules' husband was played by some actor with better acting it'd have been stellar. Anders really didn't make me connect with or feel for the husband at all. His face was the same 99% of the time he's on screen. Anyhow still a well-executed, emotionally mature, well-written movie to watch. Kudos to Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway.",4.5,"Jun 19, 2021"

,"Robert De Niro ha trovato ormai casa in queste commedie in cui può esprimere un lato più divertente di sè, a lungo sovrastato da grandi performance drammatiche. ""The Intern"" è un film piacevole, originale e con davvero pochi difetti; lo si guarda con piacere dall'inizio alla fine. Magari, sarebbe stato interessante, completare la sceneggiatura con qualche personaggio di contorno più interessante, a tratti si sente un po' la mancanza.",4.0,"Mar 10, 2021"

,"The two stars are fantastic and well matched, but Hathaway's character get a terrible sexist arch that seems to defend men cheating on women if they are too impowered.",2.5,"Jun 9, 2020"
,"""Mark Zuckerberg never brought in a CEO - and he was a teenager!"" The movie is about love, life, lessons, falls, and getups. Surprisingly touching and happy. It puts life, feminism, work, marriage, kids on the table and discusses it. Life lessons are demonstrated naturally and not in a boring way. De Niro still a great actor. Now older, he is doing more dramatic movies and the man still on fire. Some facial expressions are his and no one else could ever do it. The chemistry he got with Hathaway is touching and happy. It's almost as they are connected with each other and with you and me. And what about Hathaway? She is gorgeous, frenetic, and as expressive as De Niro. They could do those scenes without even talk.",3.5,"Jun 3, 2020"

,"Its story is quite cliché, but it is redeemed thanks to its modern approach and the chemistry of its leads.",3.0,"May 11, 2020"
,"I love this movie. I've seen this several times. It's a feel-good film. I think the whole world should have a Senior Intern because it helps them to adapt with the new norms. It also make them feel that they belong or they are still part of something....a community. I love Anne Hathaway. I think she's a great actress. The relationship of Jules (Hathaway) and Ben (De Niro) is very admirable. He's like a father to her more than a colleague. What I didn't like though was when Matt (Jules' husband) had an affair and made Jules feel that it was her fault because her company became successful in less than two years. However, the ending was great. Everything just fell into place.",4.5,"May 8, 2020"
,"So this is what Anne Hathaway did after she left 'The Runway' in 'Devil Wears Prada'. Are we in some sort of Anne Hathaway and fashion cinematic universe perhaps? Even if we are, I would not mind it. Jokes aside, 'The Intern' is truly a heartfelt, cheerful and emotionally uplifting film powered by beautiful and nuanced performances by Rober De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Some subplots can feel irrelevant to the final story and feel crammed in to fit the runtime. By no means, the film gets boring but you feel that there is not much substance here. The film looks good though, the cinematography is fantastic. The dialogues are quirky and witty. The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is what lifts this film from average to good! Recommended!",3.5,"Apr 26, 2020"
,"The best thing I can say about the Intern is that it doesn't suck. It draws you in so well you want it to be good. Then it punches you in the gut and you never recover. It ends with you feeling like the writer got to the 1 yard line and then he dropped the ball. Great run, no touchdown.",2.5,"Apr 22, 2020"
,"I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this movie; a retired businessman and widower (De Niro) decides to apply as an intern for a successful online fashion start-up company founded by ambitious Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) -- they are generations apart but they find a way to successfully work and support each other. Along the way, both are able to find friendship and reliable people they can count on. Highly recommended!",5.0,"Apr 5, 2020"
filippo v,"It has an intriguing premise, but doesn't evolve too much commentaires aside from the clichéd situations. Still, it is charming movie and a good watch and really works because of the chemistry of Anne Hathaway (doing her best) and Robert De Niro (truly a standout).",3.5,"Apr 3, 2020"
r 9,"Commedia più che dignitosa che nasconde una morale più profonda del previsto e del necessario. Nella seconda metà del film si sbarca in territori pericolosi proponendo un'idea di fondo forzata con risvolti narrativi inconsistenti. La buona sintonia tra la coppia dei protagonisti rende comunque il film assolutamente apprezzabile, un'esperienza leggera e passeggera.",3.0,"Mar 22, 2020"
Reynold20 M,"This is one of those movies that just puts you in a happy mood. It's not classic cinema, but it also wasn't meant to be. The main success is the chemistry by the entire cast, particularly the two leads.",3.5,"Mar 20, 2020"
Pilar M,"I don't necessarily dislike this film, but it has way too many cheesy/cringey moments for me to enjoy it. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are good, though a lot of their meaningful scenes feel forced due to the writing and dialogue.

,The story was beautifully portrayed by very powerful actors.,4.5,"Feb 27, 2020"
,"Like a breath of fresh air...no violence, swearing, politics.....just considerate people. De Niro was great helping everyone out with everything...but it was a 2-way street....all the young employees were very respectful to him too. Like George Martin said about Billy Preston's time with the Beatles.....he was like a 'lubricant' ...everyone loved him, all the band members were politer to each other and in better spirits...there was no pettyness...John wanted him in the band permanently.....when Preston left he was really missed.",5.0,"Feb 14, 2020"
,"Really great chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway, subtle and intelligent dialogue. However, I think if the husband/wife roles had been reversed, viewers would not be so pleased with conclusion that 'homemaker"" should be totally behind ""breadwinner"" , shut up and mind the child.",4.0,"Feb 10, 2020"
,"‘The Intern' is a MUST SEE. The film is not only heartwarming, but leaves you with a good feeling inside. It is such a positive message that drives home what being a good person and a hard worker means. One of my favorite movies of all time.",5.0,"Feb 6, 2020"
,"It was... okay? It really liked playing with old people stereotypes but not in a bad way just in a ham-fisted way. I don't really know what the movie was trying to teach me. What I got is, ""Woman can be good bosses but also should forgive cheaters.""",2.0,"Jan 18, 2020"

,"One of the best feel good movies of this generation and gives a nod to old school customs. I appreciated De Niro's gentlemanly, likable character and Hathaway's character development from micro to macro despite the horrendous husband debacle. Personally, could have done with out that part of the movie but critics already said this movie wasn't edgy enough... I'll watch this again, to me that says it all...",4.0,"Dec 31, 2019"
,"The Intern suffers from lack of ideas, their development and history itself. Everything unfolds in areas almost white phones of the golden age of Hollywood.

,"Hathaway is in great form in The Intern. She really is believable as CEO Jules Ostin and really excels in the role. Nancy Meyers really excels at these rom-com movies that make you feel like the characters are believable and the storyline (even no matter how absurd) might actually be believable. Aside from Hathaway, De Niro is a breath of fresh air as a 70-year-old widower who is just trying to figure out life as a retiree. The only negative that I could grasp from this movie is the fact that all the younger people took a page from De Niro's ""experience"" and started molding towards his way of life, but he never reciprocated that behavior. I guess having him sign up for Facebook? As a Workaholics fan, I really enjoyed seeing Anders in a more serious role and he really performed it quite well. Well until he had to cry that is.",4.0,"Jan 25, 2019"

,"The Intern is like a stack of pancakes. It's warm, sweet and leaves you with a touch of a belly ache. You are, no doubt, drawn in by the casting and who could resist a movie that brings together Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway? They're the best actors of their respective generations, but - WOW! - you keep wishing that they could find each other in a better movie. The Intern isn't bad exactly; it's light, breezy but is of no real significance. De Niro, who seems to have retired from the hard-boiled, challenging roles that made him famous, plays a good-hearted retired widower named Ben Whittaker. Retired from a now defunct company that made phone books, he now spends his days trying to figure out how to spend his days. His wife of 42 years is dead and he needs a challenge. So, he answers an ad for an outreach program for senior interns (senior as in age) to help out at 'About to Fit', a successful internet company that specializes in women's clothing. Ben gets the unenviable task of being the intern to the company's CEO, a supposedly tough-as-nails career woman named Jules Ostin (Hathaway). She claims she doesn't need him, but Romantic Comedy Law demands that she discover how much she really does need him, not just in the office but in her personal life as well. He becomes her driver (Driving Miss Hathaway?) and eventually he becomes her confidant. The two build a nice friendship that, it's a relief to report, doesn't bloom into a May-December. The problem is, that's about it. The movie is as bland and superfluous as it gets. Director Nancy Meyer sets up the inner-office environment with the reverie of shop-worn sitcom. It's pleasant and nice but it's only established so that Ben's old-school experience can teach the young a thing or two, but none of it has any significant payoff. The people around the office are young whipper-snappers whose function in the film is to be young whipper-snappers and they don't matter either. They aren't developed as characters, they're just onlookers to Ben's successes. Ben develops a half-written and pointless semi-sorta-romance with the company's on-site masseuse (Rene Russo) which goes nowhere and ALSO doesn't seem to matter. The plot developments are pointless too. Are we surprised to find that Jules' home life is burdened by the fact that her husband Matt gave up his career plans to be a stay-at-home dad? Nearly all of Jules and Matt's scenes are dedicated to talking about the fact that they never see each other. Hmmm. For about the first hour of The Intern I was fairly bored. I liked Jules and Ben but I wanted the movie to clear out the junky plot points and just let them talk, let them be human beings who connected with each other. To that point, the movie had no real dramatic tensions . . . then it happens. A dramatic situation develops that actually seems to give the movie some dramatic weight. Not to give anything away, but Ben discovers something about Matt that troubles him. When he brings it to Jules, the two have a heartfelt conversation that seems to be drawn from the characters, not from the screenplay. Unfortunately, the results of that dramatic event are crushed by a resolution that nobody - but nobody - is going be happy with. The Intern was written and directed by Nancy Meyers who specializes in cupcake-sweet confections like It's Complicated and Something's Got to Give and the Father of the Bride movies. Her films seem to have a consistent pattern. They contain a germ of human interest wrapped up in a gimmicky script that is fit for a bad television sitcom. The exception is a great comedy she made 30 years ago called Irreconcilable Differences, about a kid who divorces her squabbling parents. That movie had truth and human interest. The Intern has only faint echos of humanity. It has moments here and there when it shows the promise of what it might have been. It's a nice, sweet, uncomplicated movie that will begin disappearing from your mind before you get out of the theater and will have left you completely by the time you get to the car.",3.0,"Dec 19, 2018"

,"This is a heartwarming movie, despite a muddled plot, uneven performances, and some implausible situations. Robert DeNiro stars as a retiree who led a traditional business life and is struggling with boredom during his retired years. He wants to get back out and meet people with purpose, and enrolls in a senior intern program at an internet startup. Apparently this place only employs people under 35 who also happen to be loveable characters with some simple problems that DeNiro's character can solve. DeNiro plays his character compellingly but a little too straight to convincingly be able to win over the heart of anyone he talks to in just a couple minutes. Sadly, the other actors are not up to caliber, with a wincingly badly directed and badly acted scene at the climax of the film. Also, don't think too hard about this movie, there are Plot Holes. But it is nice to see a movie valuing the wisdom that often comes with age, even if they overdo it quite a bit. It is pleasant.",2.5,"Oct 28, 2018"

,"Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro has been hitting bad times recently in terms of the quality of his film. Appearing in garbage such as ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Little Fockers"" and ""Dirty Grandpa"". It is nice to see that among the trash is a movie deserving of his talents and worth your time. ""The Intern"" is not specatular by any means. However there is a lot to like about it. The thing to like the most is DeNiro. He carries this movie on his shoulders and does so very well. He also has very good chemistry with Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway. Their scenes together seem very genuine. Almost like they are not scripted. He alone makes this movie worth seeing.

Robert De Niro's character is too perfect, the ending is tied up way too neat, the scene where they break into the mother's house belongs in a different movie, and so on.

,"SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Well Greg, Robert De Niro doesn t appear to be in any hurry to retire -- both in real life and in this movie. GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I found the whole thing (re)tiring. Let s recap: SCOTT: We meet Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower who is restless and dissatisfied with his life as a retiree. While searching for something meaningful to do with his time, he stumbles across an advertisement for an senior internship program. He decides to apply as an intern at a company called About The Fit, a fast-growing business that sells fashionable clothing online. Ben s interview goes well and he is hired as an intern. GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) But his new boss is Jules: a high-strung workaholic young woman (Anne Hathaway) who micromanages everyone. At first she shuns Ben claiming that she doesn t need an assistant. Ben employs his old-school discipline of never leaving the building before the boss and picking up the boss s loose ends. One day, he notices her driver is a bit too drunk to drive and he takes his place as Jules driver. And before you know it they re best buddies. SCOTT: If you ve been following our movie reviews over the years, you know that I haven t been much of a fan of Robert DeNiro s recent body of work. With The Intern, there is now some promising indication that his slump is over. DeNiro shines in his portrayal of a retired gentleman from a bygone era who takes on the role of a rookie intern in a quest to inject his geezerly life with some meaning. He not only finds what he is looking for, he also manages to endow several other people s lives with richness, wisdom, and direction. The hero s journey here takes on a unique and interesting form. Ben starts out as a useless minion to Jules, but over time he evolves into a trusted sidekick. By the end of the film, Ben is arguably Jules equal, and also her mentor. To the extent that Ben and Jules are equals, one could argue that they are buddy heroes who follow the classic pattern of being at odds with each other at first and then grow into BFFL s. Whether Ben is her sidekick, mentor, or buddy is open to interpretation here. Regardless, their relationship evolves and becomes transformative for them both. GREG: I thought this movie was too reminiscent of last year s The Interns starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. Similarly, we have two older salesmen who teach old-school lessons to the Internet savvy youngsters of Google. The Intern is a little more personal in that Ben takes on a more mentorly role early in the film. In fact, he much reminds me of a butler similar to Hobson in 1981 s Arthur - or even Mary Poppins. He takes Jules daughter to kindergarten and fixes her relationship with her stay-at-home husband. Scott, we just reviewed The Martian where astronaut Watney graduates from hero to teacher. In that review we noted the ultimate destination for the hero is to become a mentor. And I think we see this pattern revisited here in The Intern. Ben has been a leader of a major company and has retired to a sedate life. Now, with this new opportunity, he has a chance to pass on his wealth of knowledge not only to Jules, but also to all the members of her staff. He has found his final destination. SCOTT: Greg, this movie has a sweetness to it that I found extremely appealing. Both of the lead characters need something, and what they need can only be found with help from the other. Jules wants to be seen as independent and so she resists Ben s help. She is smart enough to know that Ben represents no threat to her authority and legitimacy as a leader. So she bends, and as befitting a good hero story, her receptivity to change is brought about by a deep hurt -- the devastating reality of her husband cheating on her. As you point out, Greg, Ben himself has already accomplished in life many of the goals that Jules is now seeking. And so he is developmentally ready to just assume a helping role, a mentoring function. As they say, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. The first half of this movie is devoted to Jules not being ready. All heroes are humbled in some way, and this ends up being the key to her openness to transformation. I enjoyed watching these two heroes do all the things that heroes do when they are in two different stages of life. Thirty or forty years in the future, I can easily envision Jules doing all the things that Ben is doing in this movie. GREG: Actually, Scott, I found this movie somewhat patronizing. Aside from Jules, all the other characters in the story were caricatures and stereotypes of millennials. Ben is seated with the other interns, all of whom are recent college graduates. Young Davis is being kicked out of his parent s basement. So Ben takes him in and teaches him the importance of getting out of bed on time and dressing in a suit and tie. Young Jason is too interested in partying and Ben shows him the way of moderation. And young administrative assistant Becky is drawn to tears when she fears Ben is getting more attention than she is. I ve got a degree in marketing from Harvard Wah wah wah And of course Ben calms her down with a pat and a hanky - then pushes Jules to delegate some of her authority to Becky. These are all stereotypes that will appeal to the older crowd, who appear to be the target audience. There s no nuance here. Jules is the female Mark Zuckerberg who needs a nudge to realize that if she s going to play with the big boys, she has to grow a pair. And it s Ben s gentle nudging that gets her there. I found it all very patronizing verging on condescending. SCOTT: Sorry you felt that way, Greg. The Intern represents a comeback of sorts for actor Robert De Niro, who shines as an older man looking for a way to live a meaningful life. His heroic urge to mentor others is fulfilled when he is partnered with a rising business star, played with great zest and skill by Anne Hathaway. This movie accomplishes what all good hero stories should accomplish it teaches us that when we re young, we need good mentors. And that when we re old, we need to give back, to do good mentoring. There s nothing condescending about needing help and giving help; it s just a reality of lifespan development. For giving us a sweet tale of two lives intertwined across generations, I award this movie 4 Reels out of 5. The two hero s journeys of our lead characters are fun to watch, and they show how two people who need each other can help each other grow and evolve. Ben is wise enough to know he needs to come out of retirement to meet his need to mentor, and Jules becomes wise enough to recognize that she needs mentoring. The movie s ending is ambiguous -- does Ben no longer need to mentor? This dual hero story is moving, sometimes silly, but compelling overall. I give this pair 4 Heroes out of 5. The supporting cast is adequate but not terribly memorable. Another intern is a comic figure. One of Jules employees is also comedic in a pathetic sort of way. There s no real villainy to speak of. This is a story of people growing and developing more than it is a story of overcoming any particular villain. Overall, the supporting characters earn a decent rating of 3 out of 5. Movie: Cast: Hero: GREG: I found The Intern to be an overly simplistic, melodramatic, under humored and pandering to the older generation. Even the idea that a woman could run her own company was undermined by her having to be taught the values of bygone days by an older man. I felt it was a boring, and like it or not, condescending look at a fantasy of modern business. I can t muster more than 2 Reels out of 5 for The Intern. I ll grant you a nice hero s journey for both Ben and Jules. It s a pattern I don t think we ve seen a lot of - a mentor who needs his up-and-coming apprentice. And an apprentice who needs the mentoring of a former hero to rise to her own potential. I give these odd-couple buddy heroes 3 out of 5 Heroes. The supporting cast were all weak cardboard cutouts of young people stereotypes. I ve already outlined my thoughts on them. 2 out of 5 Cast points. Movie: Cast: Hero:",3.0,"Aug 16, 2017"
Serge L,"30-year-old CEO, Jules (Anne Hathaway) who has grown up her company with more than 200 employees in a year and a half. Time is too short for her to be perfect for both home and work. She gets a 70-year-old intern, Ben (Robert De Niro) who have been living his life and trying to start unconventional life after retirement. Ben's first job as a senior intern coming through a senior intern program is Jules's secretary. She feels uncomfortable to him because he is older than her. However, she starts to open her mind to him, who is always polite and attentive to her. It cannot be found free time of her life in the company who is involved in the all managements of in the company and rides a bike in order to manage her physical fitness in the company. Jules' company is a big online shopping mall, and all the systems are very high-tech, but Ben is still analog. However, he fully adapts to work in the job due to his rich lifestyle and unique sociability. He has used to analog, but his mind is still hot. Although he may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of today's concern over different from the average 70 years old people we imagine. However, as like the impression given by the title ""intern"", in the beginning of this movie, an unusual intern gives the impression of enjoying an interesting intern, but it starts to escape from the topic more and more. Even though it is not an ordinary intern, it is what happen when trying to break through the point that if the company looks reality, there are many restrictions. When it shows the company, it uses to be able to make a horizontal and autonomous image, rather than a vertical structure, but it uses to utilize images of Ann Hathaway's active and Robert Hathaway's warm. Fortunately, the images of the actor are naturally melting into the film, they are helpful to make the movie brightening. Even though it is unrealistic to express the company. These are the characters that are unhate, so they become more empathetic and more sympathetic to the changes and events involved. It becomes a great attraction to the movie. My discussion of the events is in fact addressing the larger matter of limitations of situations. It has succeeded naturally to make tenderness in the beginning, but repetitive situations make the audience bored and have forced the limitations of setting from the setting of a drastic change. It might be said that this movie is chiefly about interns on the company. But the problem with this movie, in my view, is that movies have become closer to mentor than intern. It turs out as a campaign to hire a mentor as old intern. The view of the movie, which focused on interns, is narrowed the focus on the two people. Events of outside of the company are increasing rather than outside of the company, and even an event that is kind of offence, is added for a tension of the movie. At this point, the fresh characters have only difference from the company, and it is similar to the relationship between father and daughter. Ultimately, what is at skate here is that the relationship just as mentor between the two, rather than satire of company's culture through comparison and contrast between the older generation who devote themselves to the company for the half their lives and the younger generation who start to delicate to the company. It may be that the life of an intern is portrayed as an ambiguous point, and may have succeeded in finding intern like an angel in fairy tales.",3.0,"Aug 9, 2017"

,"The intern tells the story of Ben Withaker, a widowed 70 year old retired successful businessman, wonderfully played by Robert De Niro. Ben has taken Einstein's quote 'Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.' to heart. As he struggles to keep himself occupied with, yoga, tai chi, mandarin and violin classes, and ignoring the advances of various senior ladies, he manages to land an internship to an overgrown start up that struggles to keep up with its own success. The founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) is a success driven woman on her early thirties. Jules, with unconventional methods and business vision has driven her once small business, About The Fit, to the top list of fashion e-commerce sites. During the first good part of the movie Meyer's makes great use of De Niro's charisma to portray the angst and fears of a whole generation that more often than not is too easily dismissed and ignored. As De Niro predictively proofs himself valuable and wins over the millennials who at first looked down on him, the viewer starts to fall in love with the chemistry that an enthusiastic Hathaway and De Niro build up. We like the pair, and it shows. Ben is respectful, dresses in a suit, keeps his cool and basically does everything better than everybody else. The senior man invisibly brings to Jules life, that has been overtaken by fast paced meetings and 14 hour working days, much needed support and calmness. As the film progresses, Meyers slowly drifts the focus away from Ben's impact on About The Fit, to focus on the founder's life. Jules is married to a stay at home dad, with whom she has an adorable 9 year old daughter. Her family feels that she is not giving them enough attention, while the investors are pressuring her to hire a new CEO. Here, the Meyer's work hits and elbow point, and slowly becomes more about proving a point than telling a compelling story. We painfully see how the movie degenerates into a rant about feminism, relationships, success, manlyhood and well, so many disperse things that it resembles more to a 3am Tumblr post than an A-list studio production. For most of its running time The Intern gets off to De Niro's amiability and Hathaway high energy, but as the movie progresses to the end we are left with a bitter-sweet aftertaste. We can't help but think that Meyers did to the intern what a freshman college student does to his midterm paper. It starts promising, but the spectator quickly ends up feeling like a literature professor reading a paper pushed trough with unhealthy amounts of caffeine.",3.0,"Apr 8, 2017"

,"With good performances from Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro, as well as competent writing and direction from Nancy Meyers, The Intern is a perfect example of a 3 out of 4 star movie; it's a surprisingly entertaining but uncomplicated film. I can't object to most of the many criticisms levelled at it, but the movie's a genuinely pleasing and kind-hearted experience if you're willing to give yourself over to it. In following a 70-year-old retired man who can effectively resolve just about every problem Hathaway's character faces, it has justifiably been criticised for having an outdated, paternalistic bent. Part of the reason the film fails in this regard, I think, is because it tries to deal with both aging and gender roles and doesn't consider how a nice idea in one context (lonely old man reintegrates into society by helping those with less life experience) can be ill-conceived in another (perfect man repeatedly saves woman). Still, the film is so gentle and charming my critical impulses were mostly disarmed for the film's running time. The most troubling moment is Hathaway's character's (much-discussed) speech in which she proclaims the value of traditional masculinity and expresses sympathy for the supposed infantilization of contemporary men. What she fails to discuss is how this may be seen as a by-product of the privileges afforded men within a patriarchal system. The issue is not, perhaps, that men have been disadvantaged and can't grow up, it's that the benefits they receive by default mean they don't have to grow up. Regardless, it should be noted that this speech is given when the character is dangerously intoxicated and the De Niro character himself doesn't actually really fit within a traditional idea of masculinity. He's professional and chivalrous, sure, but he's also a self-described ""pile of mush"" and a self-proclaimed feminist. Perhaps this is wishful thinking, but the film does provide fodder for an interpretation in which Hathaway's speech is not read as accurate. Bonus points to Meyers for including enough sort-of allusions to Taxi Driver (De Niro practising phrases in the mirror, De Niro driving people around) that the film can almost be read as a kind of subversive anti-Taxi Driver in which the subject is not violence and alienation but kindness and simple human connection. Oh, and add me to the chorus of people pleased that the film is, for a Hollywood picture, relatively age-appropriate in its approach to romance (Rene Russo is still substantially younger than De Niro, but at least he's not dating someone half his age).",3.5,"Feb 6, 2017"

And I thought Christina Scherer as the flustrated secretary, ""Becky"" was absolutely adorable! I saw this movie on store shelves, but had some doubts about it.

,"Hey, this film is pretty decent. Despite the endless venture of Robert De Niro into being type-cast in bad comedies and the post-Oscar notoriety of Anne Hathaway, the film turned out to be a fine cooperative effort of the two, with De Niro's subdued father-figure perfectly complimented the bright but arrogant youthfulness of Hathaway. The film did try ""to be cool"" but its sincere approach to the world of start-ups should be commended, especially given its very progressive but not too provocative touch on feminism and the conflict between career and family. It might get some laughs out of the audience too, albeit cheap laughs. Many things about this film can be considered unrealistic, including its heart-warming ending, but unrealistic optimism is sometimes still in need, especially in such ""dark"" worlds of young entrepreneurs and old ""retirees"". One last thing - the costume designer of this film deserves an award, or at least a raise, as not only De Niro and Hathaway, but even small roles of nameless supporting actors/actresses were dressed extremely well.",3.5,"Dec 30, 2016"

dan m,"Have you ever watched ""The Intern""? I at first watched the commercial on TV and it impressed me. If you watch this film, you will absolutely inspired it. ""The Intern"" is one of the best touching film. This is a 2015 American love comedy film directed, written and produced by Nancy Meyers. The film starts Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in the two leading roles. The film was released on September 25, 2015 by Warner Bros. Ben(Robert) was nothing to do in his life because his wife was passed away, and he retired from his job. On the other hand, Jules(Anne) planned to hire senior person. Then Ben applied for it and passed it to take charge of Jules. But Jules dosen't like senior person because of her mother. So, she didn't assign a job to Ben, but Ben always waiting for her to assign a job. While he was waiting, he cleaned the office up, became a Jules changed her mind to Ben. So, this story is about they having the rocky road to success and they are in love with others. I watched this movie four times because this is really nice, impressive and inspired Jules who working hard woman. After watched this, I was thinking about study hard like her. Until they become friends, there were a lot of things about job, love, and friend. If you watch this movie, you would absolutely be exhilarated. But I think I want this film to show more deeply love.

This film is not going to be a masterpiece, but I see it as an entertaining film that you are inevitably going to have a good time in, even with a simple story, it offers heart and the connection between this CEO and the much older intern is what really makes this film amazing and important.",4.0,"Oct 22, 2016"
,"I was surprised how much I liked it! This is not great cinema, and will probably be forgotten long before Citizen Kane, or Casablanca, or Cries and Whispers, but it was fun to watch and we enjoyed it, start to finish. It was somewhat sappy, highly predictable, and entirely without anything that would make you question its PG-13 MPAA rating. But these were people you could see yourself sitting down to have a meal with and know that you would enjoy it. Anne Hathaway was radiantly beautiful as the high-powered entrepreneur of a wildly successful eCommerce fashion house, whose marriage and home life was suffering, while Robert DeNiro came across as a father figure while serving as her intern. It was good to see Rene Russo and Linda Lavin and to hear Mary Kay Place's voice, as each played small, but important roles. I hesitate to call it a romantic comedy, as the two leads were never in danger of becoming lovers (although one would have to say they each came to value the other as more than colleagues) and there wasn't a lot of laugh out loud moments, but the overall tone of the film left one feeling good about the people and their relationships.",4.5,"Oct 20, 2016"

,"The Intern is without a shadow of doubt a 2015 film. 20 years ago, The Intern would not of been made. Atleast, not like this. It handles a driven, young working woman with seemingly infinite hustle and a stay at home father with nary a hint of ridicule. The characters accept this as simply as you would wearing socks with shoes. The elephant in the room is Ben, played supurbly by Robert De Niro with just the right mix of understated sensitivity and decades of life experience without the ""I told you so"" snark. Ben's the very senior intern to Anne Hathaway's Jules Ostin, a hustlin' 21st century sister doin' it for herself, her daughter & her stay at home husband. Ben never condescends, is always humble and willing to go above and beyond for the good of his motley crew of co-workers. This is taken to it's logical conclusion during a daring heist Ben heads up with his fellow desk jockeys to delete a disparaging email their not-so-fearless female leader accidently sent to her mother. Easily the film's most ridiculous moment, but it didn't outstay it's welcome and serves as an effective palate cleanser in the middle of the movie. There's an interesting twist a little after the hiest which was definitely needed, because as good as The Intern is, it never layed down a firm mission statement for either of the leads to accomplish by the end, and the twist gave some welcome drama to what I found to be a very enjoyable, sweet and likable film.",4.0,"Sep 11, 2016"

,"A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. The founder of the company is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom. Good, and surprisingly so. I was expecting a farcical half-baked comedy about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern gadgets and work processes. There are a few examples of that but the movie is far more than a story about generational differences. It's more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too. There's themes of generational wisdom, not judging people by their age (or anything superficial) and making the most of people's talents. It's also a movie about starting over, and doing what you enjoy. Moreover, it's simply a nice story. Solid work by Robert De Niro in the lead role. He doesn't do bad performances, but that hasn't stopped him in the past from taking on roles and movies that are well below his standards. This is not one of those roles or movies. Sensitively played, and ideal for the role. Good work too by Anne Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go-getting entrepreneur.",3.5,"Aug 19, 2016"

ole o,"A film that differentiates the young and old generation. I would definitely say it is the director's best film. I have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them. I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it. Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway. You are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here. This is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people. So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part. From the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world! 8/10",4.0,"Aug 17, 2016"

,"*** Average I am internally grateful that you are taking a few minutes out of your day to read my cheesy review of Writer-Director Nancy Meyers' comedy ""The Intern"". I hope you make it through this puntership with flying colors. Anyways, the movie stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker. Ben is a 70 year old widower who is living out retired days, but needs to fill a void. He comes across an opportunity to be an intern in a senior citizens' internship program for a start-up fashion online company. Anne Hathaway co-stars as Jules, the Founder of the company who at first is reluctant to work with an older crowd, but then takes a genuine liking to Ben as not only a dependable intern, but a father figure. Of course, there are conflicts that are incorporated into the film that causes their relationship some challenges, and Jules' own relationship with her husband. I admired how Meyers directed the first hour of the movie, but then it looked like ""The Intern"" ran out of steam during the second half with too many elongated scenes; and that is why I could not give ""The Intern"" a review promotion. I did like De Niro as Ben, and Hathaway as Jules was not too shabby either. ""The Intern"" was 2 hours long, it didn't have to be.

,"Ben (Robert DeNiro): ""You're never wrong to do the right thing."" Jules (Anne Hathaway): Who said that, you? Ben (Robert DeNiro): Yeah. But I'm pretty sure Mark Twain said it first. This was kind of cute, sort of a revese ""Devil Wears Prada"", but it lacks the quirkiness of Prada to make this film truly endearing. It tried just a little too hard to be likable and sort of missed the mark- the comical scenes weren't really all that funny, the serious parts seemed insincere. Robert DeNiro (Ben Whittaker) was genuinely adorable though- probably one of his few characters you didn't to punch in the face. The best parts of this film were Adam Devine (Jason) and Andrew Rannelis (Cameron). Overall, it's not a bad film, it has a good heart just not genuinely heart-warming.",2.5,"Jul 3, 2016"
,The Intern teams up Deniro and Hathaway in a romantic comedy about a young boss of a fashion company that hires a 70 year old intern and how these two become best friends and confidants.

The plot line was fun to follow and while bad things definitely happened, it was fantastic to see them play out and resolved in great ways.

,"Who would have thought that Romantic Comedy star Anne Hathaway would ever be acting alongside Gangster Film star Robert De Niro? ""The Intern"" stars both of them respectively and say what you will about sappy plots like this, ""The Intern"" is a very, very good film about life in general. Following a widower as he tries to keep himself busy on a daily basis, not matter what it is, Ben (De Niro) is hired as a senior personal-intern to Jules (Hathaway) at an online fashion website. Fitting right in as he had a very long career in business, they form an offbeat friendship that nobody would have expected. This film truly is about friendship, family, and life in general. That is the main focus and it handles it wonderfully. Giving needed life lessons to the new/younger generation, while still caring about it's older audience, this film balances the old and the new in such an interesting way. Having a young family who clearly doesn't see their father's very much, Ben becomes that figure in their lives and changes it drastically, for better or worse. Everything about this film moves at a very solid pace and you feel like it is giving you a slice of life at this moment in their lives. Where this film falters, is the choices made by some of the characters in the final act. It began to feel a little less like life itself and more like a movie when decisions being made felt like plot devices in order to have the happy/sad ending that it went for. It tries very hard to pull on your heart strings and I did not buy into the emotional impact of the final few scenes as the decisions felt very forced, in my opinion at least. I did not believe that this particular conclusion would have happened in reality, and while the film played out as a very realistic picture, that shift in tone was jarring to me. ""The Intern"" does benefit from an experience writer in this genre, which is why most of the film is so great. Nancy Meyers writes and directs this film, and while her earlier films such as ""Father of the Bride, The Parent Trap, or ""The Holiday"" have all been enjoyable, films later in her career such as ""Father of the Bride 2"" or ""It's Complicated"" really hurt her pedestal. Thankfully, this film has put Meyers back in the spotlight and I look forward to see more of her work in the future. With all the right feel good moments, compelling character developing scenes, and the perfect amount of levity between young and old characters, ""The Intern"" is a far better movie than it should be and I highly recommend it. Very solid entertainment.",4.0,"May 17, 2016"
,"Nancy Meyers, not many people do it better. Comedy, pretty people, relationship problems, deep thinking and everything will be just fine in the end, or even better than fine. nice diversion, some good laughs too.

,"Having wanted to see this movie last year but being unable to due to a busy schedule at the time. I'm currently disappointed as I wasn't able to make the time to see this movie sooner. In this pleasant feel good movie Robert De Niro plays the role of Ben Whittaker a 70 year old retired widower. After having grown tired of the monotonous life of being retired, seemingly to lack any challenge or purpose. Ben applies for an internship as a senior citizen for an online fashion retailer. It is here that De Niro is assigned to aid the highly stressed and frenetic female entrepreneur Jane Ostin (Anne Hathaway). The chemistry between these two characters is amazing. De Niro astoundeds and leaves the audience yearning for more as his old school charm shines through in this character. Hathaway also charms and creates a compelling performance. This movie deals with how older citizens are often overlooked in society despite their wealth of knowledge and experience. While also showing how women are often discriminated against when they value their career over a traditional role in the family. There's a really cool plot device that Nancy Meyers uses to show this, that I'll avoid spoiling. But I found it really awesome. But at the same time the movie try's to foster a sense of masculinity and gentry that De Niro's character (and I sense De Niro himself) feels has eroded and faded with the rise of the modern man. Overall this movie is not without its flaws. There are points in the story that frustrate and annoy. While at points being a bit thin on substance. But the charm of Hathaway and De Niro and the chemistry between them creates great moments that will leave you in a good mood. At its heart that's what this movie is, a feel good production that will boost your mood for the next day or week. While doing it with charm, class and style at every turn of the way.",4.0,"May 15, 2016"
,"Pop publications have pondered what makes Anne Hathaway so annoying. She's a perfectly beautiful and talented actress, but there's something about her that just smacks of trying too hard. Why the public prefers cool, calculated nonchalance over effusive ambition to please is an argument (perhaps loaded with gender politics) for another day, but suffice it to say, Anne Hathaway is a little bit annoying in this movie. She tries to be cool and calculated, as per Jules, her character - a self-made internet entrepreneur - but when Jules meets the titular intern, Ben, and lets that bosswoman exterior fall and starts hanging out with her dopey underlings, Hathaway (not the character) tries to be ""one of the boys"" and the performance fails. Her buzzed rant lamenting the manboys' sloppy workplace attire rings false, trite, whiney, and patriarchal. That may also be the script's fault for creating a flat gentleman hero of yore to act as Jules's foil and to be put on a pedestal as the classic man all men should strive to be. For a movie about a woman in a man's world, written and directed by a woman, it defaults to the crutch of ""behind every great woman is a greater-yet-not-flashy-about-it man who allows her to blossom into the powerful, great woman she has the potential to be."" It just happens to be cute because Ben is thirty years her senior and is more a father figure than a romantic interest. Regardless, this movie is like the Anne Hathaway conundrum. It's cute but annoying. It has the potential to challenge the incessant questions kick-butt actresses and female CEOs are asked about balancing home and work, but it doesn't. It has the potential to question why go-getting women like Anne Hathaway are thought of as annoying or fake, but it doesn't.",2.5,"May 11, 2016"
,"Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway star in the funny and touching comedy The Intern. Directed by Nancy Meyers, the film follows a retiree who applies for a senior internship with an internet upstart company and gets partnered with the company's overworked and controlling president. De Niro gives an excellent performance that has a lot of nuance and charm to it. And the writing is rather clever in its commentary on the modern workplace. However, the film's feminist agenda causes some problems; as it ignores the Hathaway character's neglect and mistreatment of her family and that her managerial style has hampered the growth of her employees.

,"I watched this movie last night with my girlfriend (who is a film major), and she loved this one. I'm not sure what this movie was trying to achieve. I suppose more than anything it could be classified as an emotion film, but it goes about evoking it in the wrong way. Robert DeNiro portrays the confident, hard working Ben Whittaker. Now in his 70's, he's retired and widowed, and in the position of having too much time on his hands. His life is stagnant and he doesn't really know what to do with himself anymore. Enter Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway), successful, confident entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar website/ clothing company. A savvy-minded person, summarized easily as a successful hipster with too much on her plate. Her company, also full of hipsters with less acumen put out an advert for a 'senior-intern' or rather an old person for the office work to make them feel useful. Ben responds, gets the job, and becomes close friends with the boss. What I didn't enjoy about this movie was the over the top scenes that were just notably devoid of the proper emotional content. Ben becomes her confidant, best friend, and business partner in a few ways. The connection between the two is supposed to be one of friendship and understanding. But on screen it seems like nothing built up to that moment. One minute they are strangers, in the next moment best friends, missing any real emotional built up. Jules husband, a kind of out of shape former businessman, doesn't seem to care about his wife in his most emotional scene. It was watching an actor trying to cry really really hard, and I couldn't connect at all. Not to mention Anne Hathaway's response is the most inappropriate garbage I've ever seen. I know people who react stronger when the girl at Starbucks get's their order wrong! The rest of the dialogue consists of cliché after cliché, and I got bored after about 5 minutes after he starts his internship. Personally it was nice to see DeNiro in his old age, acting as a sweet and lovable guy. It shows a real range in acting from his youth. A man who has been in the film industry this long deserves credit for carrying this thinly veiled attempt to make a quick buck from those of you looking for a movie to see on date night.

,"Earnest performances from its talented cast manages to keep this mushy clichéd story afloat, but with its 120+ mins runtime - it definitely overstays its welcome. Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired, widowed and restless. He joins an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) as a senior intern and quickly make friends with his old school charm and his caring nature. While Jules isn't initially kicked about the senior internship program, she quickly finds a friend and a mentor in Ben who helps her make decisions personally and professionally. Nancy Meyers is quite experienced in this genre which is a double edged sword - while she handles it with a template old-school narrative, she also induces enough clarity and confidence that helps in the overall experience. Problem with actors like De Niro is that they have such strong histrionics, its hard to see them in character and this is where he is a revelation here breaking away from that with an earnest performance. He even uses his trademark scowl with a very different result. Anne Hathaway also does a very good job but it is something very similar to what she has done in 'Devil wears Prada' or 'Princess Diaries'. The rest of the cast if I am being too critical would say are a bunch of stereotypes stuck in clichéd scenarios. While it says some right things about the ecommerce startup industry, it is too muddled and superficial in depicting it on screen. A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads who are in top form.",3.5,"Apr 5, 2016"

,"As safe as they come. So this is about a widower (Robert De Niro). Looking to fill the void in his life, he applies and gets into an internship program for an upstart online fashion company run by a young entrepreneur (Anne Hathaway). Will there relationship start off rocky, but steadily improve? Will they learn a life lesson or two from each other along the way? It has been a while since I saw a Robert De Niro movie that I legitimately liked. Looking at his film library, this goes all the way back to Silver Linings Playbook, a film that he is not even a lead in. But hey, everybody approaches their twilight years differently, especially when it comes to a career in acting, and with The Intern, I can at the very least say he has a role that he is having a lot of fun with. While I did actually like this, make no mistake: there are very few surprises to be had, and I knew exactly where this was going from the opening 10 minutes. The Intern is a very typical fish out of water story, and it is totally something that you can and probably should take your parents to. There's not a lot of conflict, all the characters learn a life lesson, and everybody walks away feeling reasonably good about themselves. You know that Robert De Niro is going to have trouble operating e-mails on his computer, and you know that what Hathaway has in success, she's lacking in experience. You've seen this movie before, and I promise you that you posses the ability to map this out with very little difficulty. The Intern is light, and surprisingly, it's not all that different from 2013's The Internship. I don't think this needed to be a full 2 hours long; it could have 20 minutes shaved off easy, and it would have been a better movie for it. De Niro sells it, and he and Hathaway look like they had a great time together, because I am sure that they did. It's very standard odd couple story, and I was able to have fun with it, mostly because of how the actors played it. I don't think it is as good as Nancy Meyer's It's Complicated, but it's a movie that I found to be difficult to hate.",3.5,"Mar 15, 2016"

Doug M,"Review: I must be getting soppy in my old age, because I actually enjoyed this movie. I know that it's extremely corny and the storyline is predictable but I found the movie sweet and DeNiro was great as the perfect gentleman. After playing the bullied victim in the Devil Wears Praia, Anne Hathaway (Jules) has gone full circle, in this movie, by running her own company whilst trying to be a mother to her young girl, Paige and a wife to her husband, who is having an affair. I liked Robert DeNiro's character, Ben Whittaker because I always wondered how it must be for the elderly, who have lost there spouse, and stuck indoors with nothing to do. Although this isn't a true story, I loved his ""get up and go"" attitude and the fact that he was willing to do anything to keep busy. Its been a long time since I have seen a film were the young have respect for there elders, which is how I was brought up, so I have to commend the director for not playing on the age aspect to much. The chemistry between Hathaway and DeNiro was also great and the fact that he knew what to say at the right time, without offending anyone, made his character unique and extremely sweet. The whole cheating husband element of the film didn't go overboard and I liked the way that Ben handled the tricky situation. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and I'm not surprised that it made such a profit. Enjoyable! Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, 66, who brought you the Parent Trap in 1998, the funny What Women Want, with Mel Gibson, Something's Gotta Give, with the great Jack Nicholson, the Holiday and It's Complicated, with Meryl Streep. Judging by her previous projects, she is obviously a master in the Rom-Com department and she has worked with some top actors, who put in great performances in her movies. She also makes original movies and introduces different elements so they're not a straight lace romantic comedies. Although this movie doesn't have any romance at all, the relationship between the two main characters is still quite emotional, even though they come from two completely different world's. Anyway, this is definitely worth a watch, just to see DeNiro in a different light and it's good to see that a 70 year old man can fit into today's world of technology and offer his lifetime experience to the youngsters. Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $200million I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Robert DeNiro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russom Anders Holm, Zack Pearlman and Adam DeVine. 7/10",3.5,"Mar 6, 2016"

,"At its surface there isn't anything new about this Nancy Meyers helmed film. There's the figurehead of the strong, difficult, woman in charge, and the comparative, mature, father figure. There's fashion, sexual politics, and the beauty of Brooklyn brownstones but not a lot else. Robert De Niro is the eponymous intern who has nothing better to do than work in a senior program after being a company man much of his life. Widowed and without much to do, he becomes indispensable to a harried woman trying to run her own company in the midst of chaos both professionally and domestically. I buy that Ben (De Niro) is a professional, and someone with a bit of class, but it never becomes clear how he is so affable and sensitive to the trappings of Hathaway's character. The plot occasionally suffers because Ben isn't a fully thought out character. He tells people to be truthful, but then breaks into a house rather than have Jules (Hathaway) talk to her mother. He tells his co-workers to be polite and treat women with respect and then watches one of them use an emotional moment for leverage in woo-ing a female co-worker. The plot ricochets around without truly understanding its characters and the ending feels a little anticlimactic because of it. The central conflict doesn't come until near the end, and there's so central villain or antagonist to the film. Most of the conflict comes from Jules' marriage, and that just shouldn't be the central premise of a film in this day and age, especially when it's tacked on at the end. If there was a better conflict this could have been a more heartfelt film.",3.5,"Feb 29, 2016"

Es posible que algunos momentos la trama peque de demasiado edulcorada, y se acerca peligrosamente a ser una película no demasiado feminista...bala que consigue esquivar alejándose del tópico, tan americano, de que ""la familia es lo primero"" (especialmente si eres mujer). Muy recomendable.",3.5,"Feb 21, 2016"
,The intern. A novel twist on the normal post graduate intern ship within high rise companies. Ben Whittaker (de niro) is a retired widow looking and longing for something to fill in his days. After seeing an advert for an intern ship for the over 65's he took the plunge and got the job. After adapting to the role he fits right in and his mentor is none other than Jule Ostin (hathaway). Delving deep into personal life of Jules there is much to see and help with and the pair build up a friendship. Lovely fun comedy movie. Cute and lovable movie.,3.5,"Feb 21, 2016"
,"I really enjoyed it! Quick pace, never wished it was over or thought it was too long. Acting was good, I want to be like Deniro's character even though I'm 45 years younger!

,"Who says chivalry is dead? Who says there are not still great movies being made. Probably the idiots that write most of the movie reviews on Redbox, or Rotten Tomatoes. The Intern was a fabulous movie. I would have given it four stars, but there was a plot point that wasn't that believable and therefore took away from what was else excellent entertainment. As long as Robert DiNero keeps making movies like this in his seventies he could go down as the greatest male actor of our time! The chemistry between he (Ben) and Anne Hathaway ""Jules"" was dynamic and most enjoyable. You could say they were better science buddies than DiNero and Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook). I would give Ben and Jules) an A+. I'll admit I was a little hesitant to see this movie...Anne Hathaway... I felt like she was getting too full of herself after hrr Oscar, Batman etc. I'll tell you what I am once again a huge fan. (Anyone remember ""Far and Away?""). She was perfect for this role. I also enjoyed all the younger ""brat-pack"" they cast as Ben's sidekicks in the movie. there were some really funny and charming scenes between all of them. I would put this right up there with ""Devil Wears Prada."" I wanted the movie to keep hoing. The characters were so enticing that you kept wanting more scenes. (maybe a part II?...I hope so) DiNero proved in Meet the Parents movie how great of a comedic actor he is. I thought his character was funny and energetic and heart-warming, and classy, and everything else that is lacking in movies today. OK so I'm not going out on a limb when praising DiNero...I get it, but it is worth my time and energy to say how great he is in this movie. I have been noticing and paying closers attention to musical scores in movies lately. I have seen some potentially good movies fall flat because of lack of music, or Too much noise. In this movie it set a real good feel and tone. The orchestrated music was symbiotic with the visual scenes. Like a perfectly mixed drink, just the right amount of sweet. The songs that were used hit the right notes also. All in all a pleasant surprise and really hit the spot (won't say ""spot on"" because I'm not British, nor do I want to be). Nancy Meyers wrote and Directed the movie and I have to give her ""Props"" it had same feeling as Sleepless in Seattle and other Nora Efron movies. I won't forget my Handkerchief when I go to Church tomorrow.",3.5,"Feb 20, 2016"
,"De Niro has found his second wind as a comedic presence, still hard to see ""Tommy"" from Goodfellas without thinking he's going to kick somebody in the teeth. Cheesy, rather predictable, but really heart-warming. Anne Hathaway is actually likable in this one, not many times I've found that to be true.",3.5,"Feb 20, 2016"
,highly recommended. affirms masculinity and true femininity.,5.0,"Feb 20, 2016"
,"The worlds best optimist The Intern does not need to reinvent the wheel, and succeeds in doing what it intended, a feel good comedy about an unlikely friendship. Where the Intern goes right is with its actors and characters. Both have remarkable and fun chemistry which is both humorous and fun. De Niro's character is absolutely irresistible as the teddy bear like Intern who turns Hathaways frown upside down. Another significant positive is that the film makes you feel very good throughout, really helping the viewer buy into this relationship. The film does not do anything remarkable, it is just a fun and cute simple and cliche movie that is just ""alright."" It does have scenes that do not contribute to the plot. Overall it is a fun and small film that knows exactly what it is even though it is faulty in the fact that it feels very predictable. Rating: 7.2 (B-)",3.5,"Feb 20, 2016"

,"Nancy Meyers is back with a flamboyant comedy, modern, inspired, light and refreshing but somehow built on solid values that everyone can relate to in some ways. A popular comedy with heart brain and some amazing human moments, this film is a little spark of hope and delight in times of highly dramatic Superheroes narratives usually lacking depth on the human level. Anne Hathaway and Bob DeNiro will give you back some trust in our humanity and delivers terrific performances throughout the film. Their alchemy is obvious and the film benefits greatly from it. I really believe this is a great film about our times, the changes, the struggles to adapt but also the importance of having friends, moral support and above all, people that respect you and love you unconditionally, because all that you will never get it from an app...",3.5,"Feb 14, 2016"

In a span of 48 hours, I saw him in Dirty Grandpa and this, and you couldn't come up with two diametrically-opposed characters if you tried. For once, he's not playing a badass gangster (Godfather Part II or Goodfellas) or a raunchy asshole (the aforementioned Dirty Grandpa). The movie also shines a light on milennial issues: The rise of technology, women running a company, stay-at-home dads. It's refreshing to see a movie where the conflict doesn't come from impending doom; instead, the conflict arises from strained relationships. The movie shows that everyone needs someone in their corner--someone to talk to, someone to be their rock in life.",4.0,"Feb 8, 2016"

,"De Niro and Hathaway - together at last! Did not expect to like this as much as I did. Goofy, broad comedy mixed with heavy personal drama, with some reasonably interesting things to say about gender roles and the role of the elderly in modern society. But it's really the two heavyweight leads who make it so watchable. Sure, De Niro's golden age is behind him, but the depth and nuance he brings to kindly old gent Ben (played with subtlety, as this is obviously a less showy role than the Bickles and LaMottas) show that he still very much has the chops - he makes the role his own to the point that it's impossible to imagine another actor playing it. The Way is typically riveting, switching between the light and heavy with her usual skill. The movie has kind of a sitcom premise, but manages to rise above it to be a surprisingly affecting platon-com (patent pending).",4.0,"Feb 5, 2016"
,Eh. Alright but I had hoped it would be more comedy ish,2.0,"Feb 5, 2016"
,"The Film is nicely shot, composed and put together, Ann Hathaway puts on a great performance I like her more and more as an actress definitely grade A but I don't think this film has a the right message that it's ok to over work and not make time or some time for your families and not expect a negative outcome because of it, or maybe I'm just over thinking things. The movie isn't shy about feminism but frankly I find it to be nonsense since Entrepreneurs who don't make time for their families male or female usually struggle in their relationships. It's kind of the case with a lot of successful male Entrepreneurs since Entrepreneurship became a thing. The film though is a great insight into the lives of Entrepreneurs, they tend to put it more hours running their business than their employees, again regardless of a persons sex it's generally the same story for a lot if not all young business upstarts.",3.0,"Feb 5, 2016"
,"I recently watched the movie"" The Intern,"" and I think the movie is great. The chemistry between Robert and Anne is so fabulous. Despite I thought the movie was a comedy movie at first, it is a really warm and fragrant one that tears wear up in my eyes at the end of the movie. Robert is so cute and he interpreted Ben really well. Although being aged, Ben still wanted to gain something in his late life. He applied an intern for Anne's company not just because he wanted to do something but he wanted to be needed. He gave advices to Julie and people all around him, in other words, he was a wise man and very experienced in everything that people would encounter in their long life journey. Sometimes you expect so hard and eagerly to show up a person who can give you advices to you when you have a hard time and I regarded Ben as the sage in this movie. Compare with Julie and Ben, life could be busy in former and could be hopeless and depressed in later, but watched how they hit a balance between their lives by learning from each other. I highly recommend ""The Intern,"" to all of my friends and you guys and I found umm...

Only complaint is that the ending felt kind of abrupt and unsatisfying.

Her strong friendship with De Niro is the highlight of the film and it completely works. The humor was extremely fun and it didn't feel forced, it flowed well with the characters. My only real issue is that the movie isn't really original. While it has a fun concept, the movie doesn't try to be anything different or new. It goes down exactly as you expect.

I can't remember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly any flaws to his character.

,"Nancy Myers directs and writes her next film in the Intern. Anne Hathaway who played the clueless intern in the Devil Wears Prada now plays a CEO of her own company. The intern this time, is the 70 year old Rober Dinero. Unfortunately Myers feels this premise is a lot funnier than it actually is and relies on this too heavily. The film relies on the typical jokes you would expect, many of which being an elderly person and their battle with new technology. The intern has some charm at first, but gets repetitive and really does not use the situation to offer much character development. The supporting characters offer the majority of the comedy, and scenes such as breaking into a house to delete an email come off as forced. The Intern feels long, and is not one of Myer's best.",3.0,"Jan 24, 2016"
,"I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't predictable like other films, they were so many scenes that i expected something might happen, but didn't which is good, it made the movie unique in a way. It was also very realistic, literally almost everything they say in the film would be something we will say at work in reality, for an instance: when De Niro (who's actually in his 70's) said something about technology, it might take a little time for him to get used to it, that's what an adult who's over 55 would say. Anyway, this movie is great.",3.0,"Jan 24, 2016"

,"I had high hopes for this movie but it kinda let me down. The movie really doesn't establish much of a dramatic arc for Deniro's character-he's unhappy and then he becomes an intern and becomes almost imediatly happy, that's about the gist of it. Rather than the idea that both generations have a lot to teach each other, Meyers seems to think that it's a one way street, with the old sage guy handing down advice to a thirty something employee. This does not make for a very engaging picture, especially since Deniro's character is supposed to be the main character. The movie also really can't decide who's Hatthaway's character should be, we meet her as a quirky boss who rides a bike within her office and accidently gives her phone number to a disgruntles client. but at the same time the movie also wants to make her inspire fear in employees similar to how Meryl Streep did in The Devil Wears Prada and the movie can not make these elements work in tandem. It's not all bad, the tech comany seems like a fun place and you do want to hang around these characters, but from a story telling perspective it's really weak, which makes the film seem overly long.",2.0,"Jan 21, 2016"

,"SPOILER ALERT So, I just got done watching The Intern featuring the ever charming Robert De Niro and exemplary Anne Hathaway. (Not to mention the ever suave Rene Russo). I have some kudos to give and a word of authorship to the script writers for the movie. 1. The movie was incredibly heart felt. It touched me in all the right places. It was sincere and earnest and never felt like it was over done or campy. The actors fell into their roles in cadence and it transported me from the beginning to the end, with ease. 2. Robert De Niro aced his performance. The movie seemed to be written with an intimate knowledge of Mr. De Niro's previous performances and ability to transcend traditional roles. I dare to say this movie may have missed its mark all together with an alternate selection for the lead. 3. Anne Hathaway and Rene Russo were charming. I'm sure it wasn't easy for Ms. Russo to take a backseat to another leading lady. But she did so with charm and finesse and her character took on the challenge of a supporting role and did so with grace. 4. The movie was heartfelt and plucked the right strings. We felt the change of loyalty and even the butterflies of forgiveness. But...and this is a very strong but... (SPOILER ALERT) The writer missed a huge huge moment to take this movie to a whole other emotional plane of existence. Ms. Hathaway is at her wit's end trying to save a troubled relationship with her husband. So, she is trying to fill a vital role of CEO at her burgeoning company. Finally, she flies, with the company of Mr. De Niro, out to San Fransisco to meet one final and promising candidate for the position. After her interview with the potential CEO, she joins Mr. De Niro in the car that is bound for their return flight to NY. He asks her how it went. She goes on to profess how he was Smart and Kind and totally took her by surprise. The moment was so endearing, I felt the butterflies rise from my stomach and the tears begin to peak at the corners of my eye. Hope against hope I was waiting for her to extend her hand to Mr. De Niro and say, ""Congratulations CEO!"" That would have wrung my heart and made me fall head over heels in love with this movie, in a way unknown to me since Free Willy. Did it happen that way? Nope. The movie dragged to make a quick recovery of Ms. Hathaway's failing relationship and ended on a furiously paced band aid for her broken heart. Come on Hollywood Screen Writers! You get paid the big bucks, your duty is to elevate your audience. This was a fantastic movie but you missed the big finale! All critique aside, thanks for a touching tale with a few laughs and surprises along the way. And a challenge to Big Hollywood, think outside the box, for once! - @josephamichael",4.0,"Jan 3, 2016"

,"This movie could have done something completely different with the premise, and while that may have had more potential for comedy, I don't think that movie would have been as good. It's funny when it needs to be, and serious when the story requires as well, and it does both quite well, with good balance, and great acting from pretty much everyone involved.

,"The Intern won't redefine cinema, not that it's meant to, but it's a sweet and clever crowd-pleaser that works equally well as a comedy and also dramatically, mainly due to the pairing of Hathaway and De Niro. With some genuinely insightful dialogue, a number of truly funny bits of physical business, and small scenes allowing us to get know and like a half-dozen supporting players, The Intern grows us on from scene to scene, from moment to moment. A poignant, character-based comedy about professional passion, the struggle to retain a healthy work-life balance, and how the unlikeliest of friendships can sometimes become the most meaningful. De Niro and Hathaway are a surprisingly perfect pairing. Nancy Meyers delivers another funny, warm, smart and sophisticated comedy for adults that features Robert De Niro in perhaps his most likeable performance ever. De Niro is his usual charming best and Hathaway takes what could have been a one-dimensional character and breathes life into her. The success of this film may ride entirely on the alchemy of these particular actors, but whatever is carrying it, The Intern gets there. With The Intern, Meyers has made another bright, contemporary American comedy with a lot on its mind - and works hard to make it look effortless. These days, it's tough to find a comedy that even aspires to sophistication. The Intern entertainingly fills that slot VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",3.5,"Dec 28, 2015"

,"Movie Review Maven Grade: B In a Nutshell: Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are some of my faves . Other faces you'll enjoy seeing are the beautiful Rene Russo, Adam DeVine, and Andrew Rannells. While the premise of this comedy is very sweet with great comic potential, the writing doesn't reach very far. It's pleasant, but bland; sweet, but forgettable. Director Nancy Meyers charms, yet plays it safe. Uplifting Theme: · Everyone wants to feel wanted, needed, and relevant. · ""You're never wrong to do the right thing."" - Mark Twain · Men, always carry a handkerchief. You'll look classy and be a hero to someone someday. Things I liked: · I loved Ben Whitaker's (Robert De Niro) video application and the fact that he admitted that he had to call his 6 year old grandson to find out what a USB port was. Ha ha · I liked the way Jules' (Anne Hathaway) office worked. For example, the receptionist was really personable and friendly. I like the idea of ringing a bell and offering applause whenever someone in the office does something well. · Anne Hathway has such a beautiful smile. · Rene Russo is aging so beautifully. I take that back....she's not aging at all. · I loved how Ben saw a problem and fixed it without fanfare (when he cleans up the giant mess on the company junk desk). Years ago I worked for a Congressman in Washington DC, hoping to make big contributions in American politics. One day, I cleaned the office kitchenette, because, frankly, it was disgusting and no one else was doing it. While I had wanted to save the world, the thing that everyone praised me the most for was being the one who actually took the time to clean the messy kitchen area. Ha ha If you want to stand out, do something that others aren't willing to do. · Overall, it's a clean date movie, which is refreshing in the wake of trashy movies like Trainwreck - If you enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada , Anne Hathaway's character in this movie will feel familiar, as if Andy grew up and started her own fashion business. Things I didn't like: · It's pretty predictable. No big plot twists or surprises. · Robert De Niro's character is a little one-dimensional, with a goofy grin on his face most of the time. - A few amusing scenarios, but nothing laugh-out-loud funny. · The movie preaches about having it all. Can you really have it all? Years ago I attended the Governor'sConference for Women in California (fantastic event) and that very question was asked of several high-powered women on a panel. They all chimed in about how you CAN, until finally, Meg Whitman (CEO of Ebay) honestly said it wasn't true. She explained that you can't have it all....at the same time. For example, one day you can be the best business woman in the world, but then the house work is going to slide or else you're too exhausted at the end of the day to carry on a meaningful conversation with your spouse. Another day you can be Super Mom, but then you won't have time to exercise or pay your bills. Ultimately, there are only so many hours in a day and something usually has to give. I appreciated the honesty of that answer and it has always helped me to set more realistic expectations about my day. Funny lines: · ""What did you major in? Do you remember?"" - ATF Interviewer #1 (Wallis Currie-Wood) · ""Grey is the new green."" - Jason (funny man Adam DeVine from Pitch Perfect ) Things to look for: · In the beginning of the movie when Jules rides her bicycle through the office, they had to have her ride extra slowly so the two girls could get all of their lines out during the scene. · Ben's closet is pretty awesome. · Here is a question for you: If you knew someone was having an affair, would you tell the spouse? Is it your place to? Would it help them or hurt them? Tips for Parents: · Jason hands Ben a newspaper to cover up his private parts when he's getting a massage. · Two F-bombs, but they're both mouthed and so you can't hear it. Someone flips the bird. · Jules and Ben watch the movie An American in Paris , which your kids probably haven't seen. It's a classic you should introduce to them! (On second thought, was it a clip from Singin' in the Rain ?) · Pre-marital relations.",2.5,"Dec 28, 2015"

,"The Intern avoids two major cliches. It does not turn De Niro's character into a joke in a 'what's-that-old-man-doing-here?' way you might expect, and downplays his thin technology skills. That is it does exactly the opposite of what the recent 'intern' comedy about Google did a few short months ago, and opts instead to tell an actual story about people. It also avoids another major cliche that goes to the heart of the plot, so I can't reveal it. So while this film is not an earth shattering moment in the history of cinema, it quietly goes about its business in a more intelligent way than most mainstream comedies (dramadies) and I appreciated that. Though it takes acting talent as good as Hathaway and De Niro to pull something like that off. When you don't get your mileage out of stuffed bears giving the finger, little dogs jumping out of windows, or people accidentally lighting their hair on fire, you find yourself in a situation where you actually have to act - because all the absurd distractions common to today's comedies are absent. Hathaway and De Niro pulled it off with great skill.",3.5,"Dec 26, 2015"
,"Writer and director Nancy Meyers continues to display her abilities in both roles with THE INTERN. Meyers' work is polished in every regard. Perhaps the silliness of certain moments in the script reaches what feels like great stretches in the aesthetic framework of the movie, these moments also constitute what are arguably necessary beats for the whole show to be dramatically effective. Meyers is unmistakably purposeful. She is, however, clearly not writing for everyone. As critic reviews will bring out, THE INTERN is not as nuanced as some would like it to be. For her intended audience, though, the movie hits all the right emotional notes while still leaving them with bits of wisdom to chew on. Specifically, THE INTERN does not simply make fun of differences resulting from age gaps (although it does capitalize on some generational disconnects for several amusing moments), but reminisces and then proposes that some ""old ways"" of doing things may still be valuable. Essentially, the young are reminded to learn from their elders. The ""moral"" of the movie can certainly be complicated beyond that, but the afore-mentioned theme gets at the gist of the values that can be excavated from the picture. DeNiro and Hathaway have excellent chemistry and their on-screen relationship seems comforting and maybe a little familiar without feeling cliche or worn out. Their performances breathe life into Meyers' script that may have come off as less interesting in the hands of other actors. THE INTERN does not particularly break new artistic ground, but it is none-the-less fun, wise, and emotionally satisfying.",3.5,"Dec 25, 2015"

,"Few movies will enthrall you like stroking in a feather, lets you feel a gentle breeze and to go back to bed with a quiet mind like a pristine lake. This is one such movie. It throws many good things for everyone to learn, understand and live but you will see them in the movie only if you want to. I could not say just a few things - there were many. The story line was pretty straight. Is Jules going to run her dreams by saying no to a ceo or stays back and let a ceo in. As an audience you feel saying it in the very beginning of the movie itself like ""Come on jules you can do it !!"". But that not how its going to work in real life. To advise others is the easiest thing to do. You might knew what's right for your friend but we miss to see the situation from their shoes. You should wait for them to realize and analyze the crisis and let them swim it. And that's what ben does and the character was scripted as on how a matured and righteous person will react to every situation. When davis had problem to find a place he didn't offer his home right away, he did let him find things by himself but when he had no other option other than leaving the place, he offered help to share his home. Ben felt bad seeing matt having an affair and could not say it to her. Marvelous acting by Robert De Niro. You cannot hide all your emotions and he revealed that in a great acting. After seeing matts affair, when in office where jules and everyone finds out that ben is disturbed - Ben could not swallow and digest what he saw and could not spit the same out. Revealing it to Jules and might have had egregious consequences in her life. But when jules finds it out, he was there to listen and talk with her. Dialogues were crucial there. He didn't advise even a bit anywhere about the situation. He asked not to worry as she can be burried next to him. Consoling with a magical touch. Even when jules stopped by his home in the end of the movie - he delivers his thought on why she should run a company in a pleasing way stating you might have taken that decision by now but you stopped by here to see me to get an assertion that you are making the right decision. That was so awesome. He didn't advise on that topic throught out the movie. Few would have advised the moment they over heard the conversation jules had in conference room. The character of ben is a summation of maturity and all goodness that a human being should possess. Listening to people, helping when needed, clean up things even if its others mess without ego, never stop to learn new things, respect fellow human being, never forget to laugh, what empathy is, when to talk, how to handle a crisis in life, respecting your spouse and to be happy with what you have got.

,"THE INTERN starts off as retired but bored Robert De Niro joins a vibrant web start up headed by the workaholic Anne Hathaway. The idea is cute and the jokes write themselves. But unlike many movies based on unusual premises, this movie quickly moves on from the quirkiness of the pair up to bring us a truly moving and interesting story. The two stars are firing on all cylinders throughout the movie. Their relationship, acting chops and a good script manage the feat of conveying Hathaway's intricate - and not entirely predictable - character development in an unusually believable manner. There is one particular scene - during their business trip - featuring just the two stars where I felt like I was seeing some of the best acting I have seen all year. And while De Niro and Hathaway are brilliant, a charming supporting cast also surrounds them. I particularly like this movie due to the male/female role reversal in Hathaway's personal life that we also saw in this year's TRAINWRECK. While THE INTERN deals with a different slice of life as Schumer's summer comedy, we once again find the pattern of a woman living in what was traditionally a male role. This time that of a harried, passionate entrepreneur who struggles to keep up with the success of her start-up while simultaneously attempting to balance family and work. THE INTERN will not get any awards or even nomination and will most likely not be remember in the annals of movie history. But it is a great example of a movie that is everything it could be. So if the premise intrigues you, and the trailer seems like something you might enjoy, then I can guarantee you will enjoy it.",4.5,"Dec 22, 2015"
,"The Hollywood film industry is stuck in a bubble. I watched ""The Intern"" on my flight home --- wow. Aside from the usual outrageously racist casting (par for the course in Hollywood: almost every employee is white, not a single East Asian employee as far as the eye can see --- in a tech startup with 200+ employees?) The storyline is filled with anachronisms pasted over startup cliches ... yes, it's open-plan, but the female CEO has a giant, walled-off office cut off from the rest of the floor (fairly uncommon for early stage startups). She has a secretary (!) who follows her around and reminds her of her schedule. The investors want to bring in an outside CEO, despite the fact that the company is wildly successful. The female CEO needs to have a condescending talk from her (white) male subordinate about how she needs to cede authority to an older (male) CEO to take over for her. She rides a bike around the office, but has a private chauffeur to take her to and from work in a giant SUV. Her husband is a stay-at-home husband, because, of course, if you have children, one parent must stay at home, and if the wife works that means the husband has to give up his career --- because two-parent working families are out of the question. She's supposed to be a startup CEO but she can't figure out how to turn off the keyboard clicks on her iPhone. It's set in 2015, but all the tropes seem to be from some version of the 1940's, except with glass walls and laptops instead of typewriters. The film industry is increasingly isolated, cut off from the rest of the world --- I suppose it's always been that way, but there's something really lazy about the insularity of it, particularly in a rapidly changing world. The vapid recycling of outdated tropes, the lack of anything but the most superficial research into anything outside their preconceived notions of social and economic changes, the lack of engagement with contemporary issues, it's really sad. The casual racism of nearly-all-white casting (Asians typically make up about 1/3rd of startup staff, yet in Hollywood, we're nowhere to be seen) is just one of many bizarre disconnects between reality and Hollywood. It is such an important industry, it literally creates the dreams of our civilization, yet they're increasingly cut off from the day to day lives of people working in anything they are unfamiliar with.",0.5,"Dec 22, 2015"

,The Intern (2015) is a drama/comedy film starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. This film has a more realistic today's generation family business story which actually hits home in my life. The movie was well put together and the cast could have not been any more perfectly selected for such a film. The Intern (2015) brings good classy comedy to the table while taking you through the day to day of a 70 year old intern in the tech world. This film does have it's usual styling or theme as all other films within this genre/classification though it does have a nice spark to make it stand out from many. The Intern (2015) is enjoyable for all ages and didn't come slam packed with innuendos and quick one liners like most of the films from the last decade. I tip my hat to those who worked hard to make a very well produced classy comedy.,4.0,"Dec 17, 2015"

I'm not sure what I like most about this movie. It could be its perfect casting choices. It could be its natural and clever dialogue. It could be highlighting the importance of classical ""manhood"". At any rate, it shows that all generations have something to offer and once we get past the preconceived notions about a person, we can see what value they truly hold.",4.5,"Dec 11, 2015"
,"Boring and pandering, The Intern - despite telling a story as languid and cliche as its protagonist - is all over the place. It feels predominantly like an old-folks' flick (i.e. Exotic Marigold Hotel, Philomena, etc.), oh but suddenly you've got some gentle douche humor from all of the workaholics, oh and you've got Anne Hathaway, an 'e-commerce' (whatever THAT is) mogul. Why? Because women be shoppin' I had one obsessive, recurring thought running through my mind, and I think it made me bristle more at every pleasantly retarded little moment - this is Travis Bickle.

,"Didn't know what to expect from this movie but I knew with Robert Di Niro and Anne Hathaway in it the movie had to be funny at least. It was and it was every other emotion too. Being older and having lost his wife he was able to be a mentor to all the younger male inters as well as others in the office. There was a line of the movie that stuck with me and rings true. I'm not good at quoting but it was something like this. When did men stop being men and remain little boys? We stopped calling women girls but why did we stop using the word gentlemen? Then she looks at the 3 guys that are also interns as well as Ben (Di Niro) and they are dressed in casual rather sloppy clothes and he is wearing a suit and tie. Looks very nice IMO and I have to agree with her. That MEN are a dying breed and they're being replaced by boys. She wasn't making a feminist statement, it's that at all. Women WANT MEN, we don't want 40 year old boys who still dress like they're in college and play video games! So I loved that she and Ben had become friends not just work colleagues. That was my favorite thing about this movie and probably why I enjoyed it so much. He may be retired but he still has a life and a purpose. People NEED him. I really liked they showed that senior adults still have very active social lives after they retire because SO MANY in my generation seem to think once you hit a certain age, everything I guess just stops? Had this exact discussion with a 41YO guy from high school just a few weeks ago and was floored by his ignorance because he's actually rather intelligent. Book smart not common sense smart. He wasn't the first to make such an asinine statement. Having been my MIL caregiver this movie reminded me of her and my Mammaw because they both had more active social lives in their late 60s than I did in my late 30s! The reason is they were single and I'm married so I don't go out with a different man to a dance or movie or dinner. LOVED that Ben took his first date to a FUNERAL! I died laughing when he gave the lady chasing him the ""I'm sorry"" look!",4.0,"Dec 8, 2015"
,"Robert De Niro has graced movie goers with his presence for fifty years. We have seen him play mobsters, lunatics, a comedian, protective father, and many more. In the The Intern, we are able to see him play someone new. Although known for his ""tough guy"" roles, De Niro finally plays a softy. Ben (De Niro) is a retired widower looking to fill in an empty part of his life. He applies for a senior intern position at an e-commerce fashion company, About the Fit. He is accepted. Ben gets paired with Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the busy founder of About the Fit who barely has anytime to even eat. Jules is a very independent, self made women who believes an intern can only be a distraction. She soon discovers Ben's great work ethic and caring ways. Eventually Ben becomes more than just the intern as the two form a friendship. Going into this film I was not excepting much, but The Intern ended up being my favorite feel good comedy of the year. De Niro gives a performance that is so warm, you can compare it to your favorite blanket. Ben is a man filled with empathy and wisdom, the ideal grandpa and mentor. Ben carried such kindness with him, it will be hard re-watching De Niro in his mobster roles. Anne Hathaway also gives a sincere and heartfelt performance. She divides her time with being a mother, wife, and running a company. Just like Ben, I really cared about Jules and wanted her to be happy. There is amazing chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway. Completely platonic, almost like a father/daughter relationship. During the film it felt like I had a inside look at their lives. We were able to follow Ben and Jules morning, afternoon, and night. Because of this, I became very attached to these characters. There lives seemed so real. Much like Ben, I am a softy at heart. Once again, director Nancy Meyers has reminded me of that.",3.5,"Dec 8, 2015"

,"Like all sensible human beings, I'm a huge Robert De Niro fan; it's no wonder The Intern piqued my interest. Alas, De Niro's character is far and away supersedes competing elements of this flick. Simply put, there's not enough substance or climax in The Intern to totally win the filmgoer over. Inexplicably, the plot shifts focus from DeNiro's Ben to Anne Hathaway's Jules midway through and never looks back. Transposition is a tricky ingredient in the recipe for cinematic success, and it only works a small percentage of the time. Nancy Myers' new film is in the failing majority.",2.5,"Nov 30, 2015"

,"What can I say but what a fantastically nice movie. Nothing amazing happens, excitement was left out when the screenplay was written. What you are delivered is 2 hours of positive affirmations from Robert DeNiro that he ""still has music left in him"" and Anne Hathaway looking, acting, succeeding and struggling like most of out generation and the issues in following your dreams and not being able to delegate. The small and simple things in this movie make you smile on so many occasions that the characters jump out at you and you can't help but feel for them. I had expectations for how the story would go and my only complaint is that it would have been good to see the results of all the advice he gave to the interns around the office while he was waiting for his email. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice calm and enjoyable movie with two fantastic actors who slip into characters as if they were already them.",4.0,"Nov 8, 2015"
,"This movie was great. There was a great use of camera angles and symbolism. The story was original with many plot twists making it all the more better. Being a feminist, I enjoyed seeing a woman in power and addressing the issues of feminism throuout the movie. It really brought attention to an untraditional household and made the situation seem realistic and a good thing. However, there was one specific part in the movie that I couldn't stop thinking about. In one scene, Matt, Paige, Jules, and Ben are in the Ostin's kitchen when Paige tells her parents that Maddy doesn't want to be her friend anymore and Matt calls Maddy bipolar on account of the fact that every other day she is has an issue with Paige. Children often have mood swings as they are trying to figure out how to deal with their emotions. Bipolar disorder is not something to joke about because lots of people struggle with this very serious mental health issue. I would highly suggest that the producers decide to edit out the few lines that have to do with calling Maddy bipolar as many people could take offense to it. This is the only reason I did not give five stars. Other than that one scene, the movie was great and I highly recommend it!",4.0,"Nov 7, 2015"

But that might have only been true 15 years ago. There was also too much of unnecessary drama that was added that wasn't really needed.

,"Let me start off by saying that I love Robert De Niro. I am a huge fan of his, even if some of the recent movies he has starred in haven't been so good, I still think he is a great actor. Ok, now that, that is out of the way, let's get this review started. The performances in The Intern are very good. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have amazing chemistry in this film. It's no Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena but it's still amazing. Robert De Niro is very charming in this movie. I'm not the biggest Anne Hathaway fan but she really did surprise me in this. She was really good and really believable. The Intern is really funny, specifically a break-in scene that had me crying. That scene was hilarious! I was debating whether to give this a 3.5 star rating but when I looked back on that scene, I knew I had to give it a 4 star. The drama was really good too. My only complaint was that it didn't know what it was trying to be. Did it want to be a comedy or a drama? I'm not saying you can't have ""dramedy"". It just had me laughing at one point, then sad, then laughing, then sad again. Another complaint I had was the pacing, it wasn't very fast but it wasn't very slow. There were a few scenes that dragged on for a bit to long and there were parts where I was checking my watch. There are a few boring/dull scenes here and there but for the most part, I had a blast watching this. It has a little bit of comedy, drama, and a lot of heart. See it!",4.0,"Nov 2, 2015"

,"Just back from ""The Intern."" Very enjoyable. Just a ""nice"" film; I don't mean that insultingly... it was just relentlessly... nice. Even when Anne Hathaway's character has a major crisis, it still wraps up in pretty much the nicest way possible. That being said, Hathaway and De Niro have great, weird chemistry together, and that's the enjoyable part of the film. De Niro is seemingly effortless in this, but it's a good effortless as opposed to some of his ""I'm phoning this in for the money"" type of ""effortless"" you see from him some times these days. In the end, it's a Nancy Meyers film... she has a certain style and it's probably not going to change. However, I really enjoyed watching both De Niro and Hathaway do their thing... good work by some of the supporting characters... sometimes that's just enough.

,"I had little to no expectations going into THE INTERN, but boy was I pleasantly surprised after leaving the theater. THE INTERN is a happy and incredibly enjoyable time at the movies. With a pretty simple premise, De Niro and Hathaway shine as these two lovable characters in an unconventional situation. Hathaway is a young CEO of a start-up internet clothing store that simply wants to please everyone. Her busy schedule and lack of business experience make it difficult to manage all of the responsibilities as CEO and a mother. The performance by Hathaway manages o show this so you can't help but like her. This type of progressive character is need more in film. Women being the breadwinner is becoming more and more popular and society and this character portrays it very well. As good as Hathaway is in THE INTERN, Robert De Niro shines the brightest as the 70 year old intern. His portrayal of Ben Whitaker is what made him one of the most lovable characters in recent film. He does whatever it takes to make everyone's day better around him. De Niro's surprising chemistry with Hathaway is what makes this movie fun. On screen these two actually feel like best friends and even like father and daughter. They both help better each other over the course of the movie and do it in a way which seems natural and unforced. All in all, with a simple story, the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro create a feel-good and happy movie that is an overall good time at the movies. (3.75/5)",3.5,"Oct 25, 2015"

The Focker character was so painful to watch I stopped halfway through the second one as an HBO movie on TV and never watched it again. It was good to see him in something ""watchable"" again. he played the subtlety of the role quite well. I hope there's a sequel so we can see what happens to these charcters.

La química entre Robert de Niro y Anne Hathaway es magia pura en pantalla, logrando personajes bastante entrañables y haciendo que la historia funcione perfectamente, incluso me atrevería a decir que ambos o por lo menos Mr. De Niro lograran la nominación al Globo de Oro. A pesar de que ellos sostienen la cinta, los demás personajes no son mal aprovechados y cada uno tiene su momento para brillar, incluyendo a Rene Russo con un divertido personaje.

,"Anne Hathaway plays a role reminiscent of the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"" with her being a young employee with a much older boss. This movie is the reversal; her a young boss with a much older employee, The Intern. The movie overall has a good tone to it and makes you laugh every so often. *SPOILER* On the contrast, much of the movie lacked any real plot that meets the casting. Some of the story lines that are introduced are never revisited and don't leave you feeling satisfied with them. For example one of the younger male employees is in love with Anne Hathways characters receptionist, they visit this story a couple times, but never put it to rest. Another example would be her relationship with her mom.",3.5,"Oct 24, 2015"

,"The Intern was a refreshing piece of cinema that dealt with the realities of ageism (specifically in the workplace) in a humorous and charming way. The plot was well thought out, well acted, and entertaining. The overarching ideas of feminism and the wisdom of those older than us were well delivered. It was truly a pleasure to see a movie that made me both laugh and cry, something I have not experienced in quite some time from a single movie.

,"Funny movie, but dragged on & the ending was pretty bad",2.5,"Oct 23, 2015"
,"Nancy Meyers has made a couple of films I have enjoyed, the now fairly forgotten What Women Want, where she got a good performance from Mel Gibson and paired him with an inform Helen Hunt, and then her following film, Something's Gotta Give, where she generated great energy from Jack Nicholson, but also went one better by pairing him with a fantastic Diane Keaton. Her next film, It's Complicated, featured a great performance from Meryl Streep (well, that's expected) but an over the top Alec Baldwin and a series of terrible supporting characters ruined the film. After a long layoff, she's back, and this time she's dragged more energy out of Robert De Niro than many of his recent performances. De Niro is great with comedy and he plays it very well throughout. The humour is not an endless series of 'he's old, he doesn't understand the youngsters and their technology' and they certainly don't try to weave in any romance between him and Hathaway (thank God). But the jokes are consistent and the plot moves along briskly, and deals with just enough depth to lift it above many films of a similar style. Of the rest of the cast, Hathaway is excellent, and like De Niro, effortless. There's a good performance (all be it occasional) from Rene Russo, and the supporting men surrounding De Niro are all fine. However, Holm feels a bit miscast as the husband. He suits the role early as the stay at home dad playing with the daughter, however, in the final act of the movie, he doesn't bring enough depth to the character to hold the weight the scenes required.",3.5,"Oct 23, 2015"

,"Gooey, sentimental, and much too long. But hey, I liked it. Hathaway and De Niro will raise your spirits, and the film's feminist angle - while not particularly fleshed out - remains a refreshing touch.",3.5,"Oct 22, 2015"
,"The Intern is a movie with a premise that hooked me from the first time I saw a trailer. The idea of 70-year-old Robert De Niro working as an intern at a young up-and-coming business run by Anne Hathaway was great. Thankfully they didn't spend much time on explaining the logic of why they were seeking employees that old, so it just got things rolling early without too much exposition. This is where the movie got my hopes up. It cut right to his hiring pretty quickly, but then it took almost half the movie before De Niro started to have any significant interactions with Hathaway. I thought the movie would be a great look at how the wisdom of our elders can be a valuable tool in the modern workplace, but he doesn't provide as much guidance as I was expecting. There were certainly moments that met my expectations, but they were few and far between. I actually started to wonder why Hathaway's character grew attached to him at all. I also felt they spent way too much time with Hathaway's family, which was the weaker aspect of the movie. I think I know what Nancy Meyers was trying to do (talk about how people still tend to belittle strong working women) but that wasn't the message I expected to be delivered by The Intern. Also, because she intended to focus on that message, it would undermine her strength as a character if De Niro did anything of significance to ""save"" her. So the theme she was striving for ended up undermining the main premise of the plot. It's a sweet enough movie to watch, and I enjoyed parts of it, but it fell short of my expectations.",3.0,"Oct 22, 2015"

There is substantial humor for the most part of the film until *semi-spoiler* it takes a more serious tone towards the second half of the film. I recommend it if you want to watch a feel-good comedy movie that touches on perseverance and independence. (10/17/15) Edwards 10,3.5,"Oct 18, 2015"

It is very hard for me to give a Deniro comedy a shot but he is quite good in this film as is Anne Hathaway. I ain't no Hatha-hater. I really like her on screen warmth and here she is strong, smart and vulnerable. Only wish the ""heist"" scene wasn't in the film.

,"The intern is a confusing movie, both in its (and i hesitate to use this term for fear of shitstorm) gender politics, its slant on experience and the bizarre likability of its two leads. It often shoots, it often misses but overall it is quite endearing and enjoyable. Director Nancy Meyers has been responsible for some of the more cringeworthy 'woman movies' hits including the atrocious 'What women want' but here she turns her eyes towards 'surrogate father' relationships. Because let's not mince words, this is what the Intern is. Real 'man's man' DeNiro is contrasted to the way these 'manchildren playing videogames these days' are, they dress like slobs, can't talk to women and don't carry pocket squares. DeNiro is a bastion of old masculinity, an embodiment of the middle class america of youre and he becomes endearing to the millennial hipster crowd by sheer can-do-ness and seriousness. Kids these days amirite? And in that process he becomes a surrogate masculine figure for quirky, overworked, overachieving start-up founder Hathaway. And this is where the politics get confusing, at least for me as a man with sympathies for feminism. Hathaway is a female Steve Jobs: precise, wealthy through her own merits and workaholic. She is also quite opposed to boys business club masculinity. But still once she gets DeNiro as an intern she is all about leaning on him as a father figure and an emblem of the father-knows-best men of yore (who knows, for instance that she needs to eat when she doesn't, or that she had too much to drink or knows both on-line advertising/sales AND the streets of Brooklyn better etc.). DeNiro is the opposite of a manic pixie dream girl, he is a Calm Progressive Dream Grandpa, the intangible but eminently crush-able strong, supportive man that checks all the boxes. Fortunately, unless you're a critical asshole, this is all not extremely noticeable, because the leads have mad chemistry together. DeNiro is enjoyable, believable and likeable for the first time in ages and Hathaway is... well great. She cranks it up to 100 and creates a complex character in work and family life and jives stunnigly well with DeNiro's respectful, helpful grandpa. The supporting cast of ditzy hipsters is these for a couple of laughs including a rather cringeworthy 'heist' scene that seemed tacked on. But then again, with the exception of Something's gotta give (and even there the humour wobbles) director meyers never could do comedy and was over and over saved by the strength of the cast. Except in What women want cause fuck that movie. So, yeah, the Intern is appealing and endearing, even if it misfires quite a bit. But if you want to see DeNiro in a good role or Hathaway once more, go see it.",3.5,"Oct 10, 2015"

,"Thanks to the chemistry of the two superstars in The Intern, DeNiro and Hathaway, The Intern is a likable movie. The story itself is flawed, yes, but DeNiro and Hathaway have excellent chemistry and create two great characters. What I enjoy, when films can do it right, is when there's no ""villain."" There are flawed people through the movie so writer Nancy Meyers is able to create dilemma, but nobody is a ""bad guy."" Her films are like this and she's mostly successful. Any movie like this is going to have a problem if the run-time is over 2-hours (The Intern is 2:01). There's just no need for it. Also, the awkward way the The Intern had Jules (Hathaway) deal with Ben (DeNiro) was a snag in the movie. The errors in the story are ones I wouldn't expect from a writer/director of Nancy Meyers' calibre. Once this clumsy part to the story is past, The Intern really takes off. With an 80% audience score, which is excellent, I'd say The Intern is definitely worth a rent.",3.5,"Oct 9, 2015"

What I didn't realize is that I didn't expect this movie to be really great, just thought it was just there. Robert De Niro is terrific in this, probably his best in a long time as I haven't seen this type of character that he plays before, and he does it pretty well. Anne Hathaway does a good job of the character that she plays, and the chemistry between them is actually the best part of the film as they are pretty much having a friendship with no hints of of a romance, which I'm glad they didn't do that. The writing by Nancy Meyers is pretty interesting in a way that I'm invested in the characters who are developed enough for me to find them likable and memorable. There were some parts that I was worried that it was going to be a big deal, but it goes by short and sweet, which I was relieved and I liked how it was handled. It's really funny, and the drama moments work really well. There were some plot elements that really did not need to be there, even if it is hilarious, and there were some predictable moments in there. But with all of that said, I clearly underestimate The Intern, and I'm glad that I did.",4.5,"Oct 9, 2015"
,One of my favorite Robert Deniro movies.,5.0,"Oct 9, 2015"
karen n,"Old interns...hmmm haven't heard of this, but I guess it's happening. This is the premise for The Intern and it's not a horrible one. In fact the first half of this movie has a few decent laughs in it. However, the movie takes a turn from hey this old guy is working in a workplace that he's not used to, to old guy and young business owner having a relationship that you aren't sure where it's going. Movies that you know what is going to happen, and what is going to be said but take forever in saying that can be frustrating and that's a little of what is happening here. De Niro is solid here, Hathaway isn't horrible, her husband in the movie is way out of place. He might as well walk around with a sign that says I'm a douche bag. Save this one for the cheap theater.",2.0,"Oct 9, 2015"
,It's not a good movie... and yet I had to give it a positive ranking because the characterization and conclusions the film makes are inherently different than films of this type.

,"Because of De Nero there was a good turnout of The Old Geezers Who Go To The Matinee Alone and we were not disappointed. A very charming movie about a 70yr old retired guy who takes an internship at a new online business. Ann Hathaway (why is everyone always picking on her? I think she's great) is the young lady trying to mix career and motherhood and being a wife. No big action scenes just fine acting by everyone and a really charming story.

,"Not to confuse with 2013 Fox's The Internship, this similar type of drama without a ship behind feels more promising, funny but not ridiculous and thoughtful which one could have expected through its poster. The story delivers something fresh, a creative idea of senior citizen internship program to present the cross-generation relationship, events that are commonly occur in daily working life and how important is the experience of the elderly to inspire the younger generation. The film moves in a smooth pace, filled with nice musics and inspiring scores, along with a gentle spirit that attracts audiences to spend time following the amusing characters for about 120 minutes but a little bit upset by the rushing second half and too unrealistic perfection on its ending. However, the warm, charming and charismatic chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is the sweetest and most beautiful part of the film to enjoy which makes us believe that we can manage well both career and family life.",4.0,"Oct 6, 2015"

It recycles familiar stereotypes and cliches that you'd expect from a movie of this genre, meaning the little personality the film has all comes from its admittedly damn solid cast.

,"Sometimes you just have to pay the bills movies are some of my favorites. I love it when great actors make silly movies about love, family and dates strictly for the paycheck. Because they are good actors, the films are typically better than average, they are professionally made and for better or worse hit the spot without making you think or making you more stupid. The Intern is a movie about stereotypes. Old people, young people, startups, New York, business etc etc etc...You can find every single cliche in this 2 hours comedy.

Anne Hathaway has real screen presence as the young CEO who has to overcome her prejudices of having an older intern. It's also good that Robert de Niro is back on screen in a decent role. While the direction loses its focus occasionally, this is an enjoyable, easy-to-watch comedy with some gentle critique of aspects of modern society and good chemistry between its lead actors.",3.5,"Oct 5, 2015"

,"""The Intern"" is a sure-fire hit for adults of all ages. Offering plenty of laughs and smiles, the film tosses in several heavy doses of reality and sadness-all mixed into an otherwise straight-forward storyline. De Niro brings the calmness and demeanor of a James Bond around an office water cooler. His charisma and gentle manners takes us back to a slower, more enjoyable life and pace that can still work in today's nonstop world. The always delightful Hathaway captivates us with her wide-range of acting tools. Together, the team of Hathaway and De Niro combine to give audiences an extremely enjoyable and warm big-screen experience.

,"Rating: Fine I know sometimes the word fine has a negative connotation, but this is definitely the real definition: ""choice, excellent, or admirable"". I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end with only some slight missteps along the way. The strongest aspect of this film is the reality of it. Throughout the story I felt that this characters will part of the real world. And when you believe that the premise behind the movie becomes the clear focus and provides great insight to society while telling an engaging story. The difference between the older generation of Robert De Niro and the younger workforce led by Anne Hatheway introduces just enough to make you question the modern day. While mentioning the actors we can applaud them because they did a wonderful job of getting us to care about the characters, it is nice to see De Niro throwing himself into a role, even if the character is mostly laid-back yet still charming. And of course Anne Hatheway remains to be one of the best actresses out there, and stunningly gorgeous. The movie is not without faults when it attempts to juggle a few too many story-lines and characters that do not always follow through to a satisfying conclusion. In the same vein some of those pieces mismatch the genuine lived in feel and just stand out as silly moments. Still this is an enjoyable tale and y'all should definitely check it out if the premise looks intriguing to you.",4.0,"Oct 4, 2015"
,Myers tells good stories especially about baby boomers and this is one of her better films due to the unexpected chemistry between Deniro and Hathaway! DeNiro is very touching and believable as a man past his prime trying to prove he still has worth and Hathaway is very believable as a Career Driven working mom who wants it all. Russo is also quite good as DeNiro's potential love interest. Myers does include one plot mechanism that threatens to derail the movie but she recovers.

,Another new little gem from director Nancy Meyers who has successfully made a modern buddy film with the most unlikely of characters. The story of 70 year old Ben Whitaker taking an opportunity as an intern to a clothing web company helmed by Anne Hathaway. Filled with great moments & characters & filled with a lot of truth. Filled with some delightful moments & was so nice to see De Niro play the lovable character. It's a charming film that isn't hard to fall in love with quickly.

,"The Intern: A Perfectly Heartwarming film, and much much more! 'The Intern' is run-of-the-mill heartwarming drama about a woman who makes good with an idea, a laptop, and a chair. It's the American Dream, you know.??Through a set of convoluted occurrences, the boss of an internet shopping company, thirty something Jules, takes on ""senior interns"" (people over 65) to work in her company. That leads to a series of 'surprises.' One surprise is that the old intern 'Ben' (De Niro) is not incompetent. Shocking! They learn that old people have something to contribute. How heartwarming! And the audience is shocked to learn that young folks don't have all the answers. Ben is so willing to help, you wonder where he has been all your life. All the heartwarming drama nearly gave me a heart attack. Suffice to say, it's predictable. The film's efforts to tell a unique story fall flat. It is apparent that this is a star vehicle with a goal of making bank on the combination of De Niro and Hathaway on the screen. It doesn't bomb because of the expertise of the two stars, but the plot drags it down. Ben, a goodhearted seventy-year-old retired divorcee, teaches the youngsters in the office new tricks. He effortlessly makes friends of everyone in Jules' office and knows exactly what everyone needs. He is the perfect intern. At one point of the movie, Jules (Hathaway) asks Ben (De Niro), ""Why do you always say the perfect thing?"" Why, indeed. He's too perfect and he brings no conflict to the table; in fact, he's boring. Sure, his homespun logic and chill advice are clever, and it is too obvious. But it is heartwarming. The overworked self-made women (Jules) doesn't have time for anyone, especially herself, as she tries to keep her company running. But she's a loving and patient woman who adores her daughter, Paige. Her husband is the 'stay at home dad of the year.' Even when things go awry in their marriage, it's so damn heartwarming that it makes angels vomit. Age barriers are overcome through clever, pat answers. A whiter-than-white cast stand insulated in a web of banal first-world problems. The major conflict in the film comes down to control and self actualization. Sure, in the context of Jules' life, it's important. For a movie, it's not terribly compelling. I'm surprised the film turned out as entertaining as it did. It helps that they didn't throw in a last minute cancer, house burning down or earthquake. That is the rankest type of plot device and I am happy that I haven't seen that in recent dramas and romances. In the film, it's all upper middle-class white America all the time, as if we were in the 50s, Leave it to Beaver version of Brooklyn, NY. I haven't seen a film this white since 'Boyhood.' Then again, an online vendor that sells clothing to ""housewives"" might attract mainly white college educated employees. Moreover, the film has to ignore class conflict in the 21st century in order to make Jules' problems at all dramatic. In the context of the world, her issues are trite and she is a pathetic whiner, type A personality who thinks her life amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world. ??Overall, it's handled by the actors: Rental For all the blandness, the two stars pull of a decently entertaining film.

,"Big Nancy Meyers fan? I am but out of all the projects I've seen of hers, this is the weakest one. Though not a bad film, had a lot of flaws particularly the writing, though it is filled with a lot of laugh out loud moments, and good emotional, intense moments. The main reason to see the film is the brilliant believable performance of Robert De Niro. He charms the screen in his role as a senior intern working for the younger generation star Anne Hathaway. Like De Niro, Anne Hathaway is also very loving, funny, believable, and is someone you can't take your eyes off. The two of them give it their all and have marvelous work/friendship chemistry together. The supporting cast is good for the most part but very underused, particularly Renee Russo. There are so many better ways the story could've gone, but this is not a very strong story. Overall though, very entertaining with much praise to the two leads. My grade=81%(B-).",4.0,"Oct 3, 2015"

,"VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse Burleson 2015's The Intern (my latest review) is great. There I said it. This is feel-good, cotton candy people. You stagger out of the theater with a sense of giddiness. Then you say to yourself, ""wow, that's a real film"". Its lead (Mr. Robert De Niro) has never been more likable. You wouldn't even know it's the same guy who played psychotics (Taxi Driver, Cape Fear), hardened criminals (Heat, The Family), and ornery grandpappys (Meet the Fockers, Little Fockers) some years ago. Crazy. With his co- star being Anne Hathaway (also very likable), screen chemistry is indeed abounding. A friendship develops between their characters producing an inner wallop. Now in all honesty, I don't ever cry at the movies. Here, I got the sniffles and that's saying something. As directed by Nancy Meyers, ""Intern"" has one of her trademarks written all over it. That would be the adage of well-off people having problems (in relationships) that aren't life-threatening. You could also include the notion of two protagonists sharing scenes and being worlds apart in age (remember Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton in Something's Gotta Give?). So yeah this flick is cutesy at times. Yeah it ends with a level of uncertainty (talking about cinema makes way for interpretation you know). Yeah it starts off sort of predictable. Yeah it has some nitwit, supporting characters and yes, there's a cringe-worthy boner gag (don't ask). But look closer and stick around for the full two hours (despite what other critics thought, the overlength didn't bother me). There's something deeper than what was advertised in the trailer. Here's a hint and spoiler alert (warning): The husband of Hathaway's persona (Matt Ostin played by Anders Holm), isn't much of a shade and doesn't hold the screen until his revelatory stance hits you up in the third act. Talk about a plot diversion in a so-called, mawkish comedy. Shot near the perky side of Brooklyn, New York and featuring an email heist referencing caricatures from Ocean's Eleven, The Intern is a romcom without the ""rom"", a centerpiece sledgehammering facets of old age (you could also throw in older people's spar with newer technology). The story starts off without a struggle or conflict before later kicking into high gear. You have Ben Whittaker (De Niro), a widower who just wants some higher form of human interaction. He's retired, he's traveled the world, he hangs out at Starbucks, and when walking down the street, he gets hit on by weird women (Linda Lavin from the TV show Alice, who'd thunk it). Sadly, this is not enough for him. The solution: He signs up for a community outreach program in which seniors intern for thirtysomething boss, Jules Ostin (Hathaway). Ostin owns a Internet fashion company, built from the ground up. She's initially reserved, conservative, and off-putting. And her first impression of Ben is that he's too observant not to mention a little invading. Then things change. As time marches on, De Niro's Ben and Hathaway's Jules form a wonderful kinship. They eventually turn into best friends. Refreshingly, it was great to see two Oscar winners thrive at the top of their game. When they're on screen (together or separate), ""Intern"" is a real winner. When they aren't in frame (which hardly ever happens), the material is sadly, a little sluggish and kind of hackneyed. Anyway, if you've recently watched The Internship (2013), you'll somewhat be reminded of The Intern. Both films start off similar yet the latter ascends to something much greater. Bottom line: Chalk up another round of effective, sentimental goo courtesy of the veritable Nancy Meyers. I'm gonna go with a rating of 3 and a half stars on this one. Of note: De Niro's Ben Whitaker has a need to fill a void in his life. He's retired with money yet is bored. That's why he takes on the task of working in e-commerce territory. De Niro the actor, well he seems to be filling that same void (Bobby's rich but still likes to appear in three to four movies a year). With endeavors like Grudge Match, Last Vegas, New Year's Eve, and 2013's Killing Season, he hasn't been too picky about his projects. The Intern thankfully, reverses this trend. Mucho ""De Niro"" justified!",4.5,"Oct 2, 2015"

,"The Intern is directed by Nancy Meyers and stars the great Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. This is the first Nancy Meyers film I am seeing and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the intern. The Intern is a sweet feel good comedy that starts off as a movie showcasing the differences in lifestyle,mannerisms and characteristics between the current generation and the older generation before heading towards the more drama heavy side of things with De Niro guiding Anne Hathaway in some of her life choices. De Niro is fantastic in this film and his character is so likeable. Anne Hathaway is great as well and the chemistry between the two is the main reason why this movie is so damn entertaining. De Niro's interactions with some of the other younger interns are also hilarious and had the audience laughing out loud. My only issue with the intern is that there are some unnecessary scenes which don't really add much to the movie and hamper the pace making it feel slightly long. The Intern is definitely worth watching when you are in the mood for something light hearted. B",3.5,"Sep 30, 2015"

,"Out of the long list of films I had planned to go and see, The Intern was nowhere close to being on that list, but when my girlfriend felt the need to tag along to the movies with me and adamantly suggested that we take a break from the norm and try one of ""her movies"", I went against my better judgment and begrudgingly agreed, little did I know she would choose a film that was finally watchable. I say watchable because this movie is basically a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada but without Meryl Streep, but instead plugging Robert De Niro in the Anne Hathaway role and allowing Hathaway to play the Miranda role without the attitude and confrontation, thus making this movie a boring heartwarming work place character piece without the drama. This film comes across as just a movie to fill a slot during a slow weekend where no prominent films that people take seriously were debuting. The pacing is slow and the characters are bland to the point that you don't care about whatever benign conflict that they try to interject into the plot to give the story purpose and I was just hoping that the movie would hurry up and reach its obvious conclusion so I could leave. The casting was about the only thing that they got right with this movie. The plot was basically a mash up of The Internship and The Devil Wears Prada but without the witty one liners or eccentric bosses which leaves you wondering what's the point. At best this is about on par with a made for tv Lifetime movie which pretty much means I am not in the demographic that this movie was trying to target, but if your into that very mellow drama kind of films then I would say it is better than most and worth you checking out",2.5,"Sep 30, 2015"
waleed a,"A Nancy Meyers film has no place for gritty realism so with that in mind, this is a safe and nice film that's slightly overlong, oftentimes sitcom-y and does exactly what it says on the tin. Lack of surprises aside, De Niro and Hathaway gave it their best to give the flimsy material some weight and drama in the third act but it was never meant to be. The takeaway here is that the technology obsessed youths can learn a few things from seniors who've got the experience of life. How delightful but hardly profound! The script could've been written by your hip grandma who has managed to master whatsapp - give it an extra star rating if you are into that sort of escapist nonsense.",2.5,"Sep 30, 2015"

,"This movie has been promoted as a comedy but its really little more that a 'chick flick' designed to propagate the idea that 'you can have it all'. Jules has a successful startup company, a loving and supportive husband and a beautiful daughter but her commitment to her career results in problems at home. The company decided to develop a 'Senior Intern' who, over time, becomes like a father to her. With the wisdom of Solomon he guides her through various problems. In true Hollywood fashion this 70 year old middle-class guy just happens to have spent his career as VP of publishing company (don't all middle class people retire from upper level management?). When the problems at home begin to take its toll he, in true feminist fashion, convinces here that even though she has little time for her family its not her fault and that she needs to be ""true to herself"". I guess that means she should put herself ahead of her family and others. Overall, a 'feel good' movie with good acting and a story line that does entertain. Were it not for the obvious sexist theme and absurd message I might rate it higher but because of its heavy political nature I can only rate it 2 stars",2.0,"Sep 29, 2015"

,"""The Intern"" is a film starring Robert DeNiro who enters a senior citizen internship program to bring a new dynamic to Anne Hathaway's start-up telecommunications firm. At first, Hathaway has a hard time warming up to DeNiro but comes to form an affecting, unlikely bond with him. This film is watchable, but I wasn't sold on the whole new-age generation gap thing. This film has a lot to say about generation gaps and that older people have to get hip with the current times. While both are highly competent actors, I thought the dynamic was a bit bizarre, and had their ages not been so vastly different, it might have worked. Both do solid acting but it doesn't make the relationship any better. I thought the film was also fleeting and absent a decent score and some interesting dialogue, this film is thoroughly forgettable. It is very whimsical and doesn't tread any new narrative ground not treaded before. This is a film meant for simple viewing without any deeper meaning --------------------------------------------------------------- C+",3.0,"Sep 28, 2015"

A mildly interesting premise - what would happen if 70 year old Robert De Niro were working for internet startup entrepreneur Anne Hathaway? At first, very little but the film builds to a nice ending, but with a firm ambition to sell you The Intern 2 too. 61 year old Rene Russo is the love interest for De Niro, The rest of the characaters are not really explored serving variously as foils for De Niro or Hathaway. Some of the plot is implausible - how does De Niro solve an IT problem that the Internet startup boss cannot? Mostly seeing this film reminded me of the character De Niro played in ""Once Upon A Time In America"", The 70 year old De Niro looks very look the aged gangster Noodles Aaronson .

,"Too entertaining to warrant a senior skip day thanks to its leads, The Intern takes a softball approach to its promising premise but moviegoers can't help but love the chemistry behind this office non-romance. Just like with any other Nancy Meyers comedy, moviegoers get introduced to a work roster of goofy but lovable supporting characters and an overall story that feels fresh despite ultimately plucking the strings of predictability. Oh, some unsuspected roadblocks might surprise you but the final trajectory's always pretty clear. What makes The Intern unique so far as this writer-director's CV goes, however, is the age of the female lead. Her ensemble work aside (The Holiday), Meyers tends to stay within her actual range (Diane Keaton, Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated). In dotcom founder Jules, however, we get a mega successful glass ceiling-breaking online store founder who's got a family to boot. Far from a caricature, she's also a spread-too-thin boss who invests in a camaraderie and loyalty-building environment for her employees (on-site masseuse, lax dress code, office bike riding), as well as no patience for her mother and not enough time for her hubby. In Anne Hathaway, Meyers finds one of the only actresses capable of coloring in and outside of her lines to a brilliant degree. You come to love Jules, just as you do the title character. Since committing to comedy nearly full time (Analyze This, Meet the Parents), Robert De Niro has gotten warmer and has gotten the audience to warm to him more as an Everyman. Notice that those successful flicks listed in the last sentence don't require much suspension of disbelief for buying the actor outside of his usual tough guy wheelhouse. With The Intern, however, we get a full drawn portrait of a still-vital retiree helping Jules through some crucial work and life changes. Hathaway and De Niro work so well together and their personalities complement so perfectly at this juncture in their lives that you wonder how they would have melded if she got dropped into one of his films during the height of his H'wood run (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas). In this PG-13-rated comedy from writer/director Nancy Meyers (The Parent Trap, What Women Want), a 70-year-old widower (DeNiro) becomes bored with retirement and takes a senior intern position at an online fashion site created and run by a much younger woman (Hathaway). Beyond Hathaway and De Niro's compatibility, however, their remains some problems with this twosome's vehicle. Fluffy is the word for The Intern, which could have made some riper social commentary as to the actual viability of pension-aged Americans in the workplace and old vs. new approaches to business. Oh, Meyers bats around such discussion a bit but she seems to be wearing an oven mitt, only lightly touching on these talking points. Still, even the color-by-numbers moments make for an enjoyable office dynamic. Bottom line: High Pension",3.0,"Sep 28, 2015"

Jeff Boam, how about stop taking others critics opinion, and making it your own. all that nonsense bullshit of how inspired you are about Myers. and instead think of your own opinion. Now a day, yes some movies are a waste of spending money to make and can't even get it right. Yes Hollywood has spent million on movies and made them pointless or a waste. but some of this Writer or Director still have the classic thoughts about how to make the movie right.

Yes, you could say at times the movie stretches its believability, esp. when I mention a certain ""robbery"" - which I could have easily lived without. And yes, the focus changes from De Niro to Hathaway in the course of the movie, but the movie is always charming, witty, and it just reminds you of your parents or grandparents and makes you wonder what live has in store for you.

I loved the interaction between DeNiro & the younger men (although he never seemed to get them to want to shave--hey guys ZZ Top is right---every girl is crazy about a sharp-dressed man!) I rated this move 3 1/2 for two reasons: the way older women are depicted (as ""raging bitches""--Jules Mom--\ complete buffoons--the intern who couldn't drive--or the pushy, lonely one-night stand--Linda Lavin's character). Older women can also be as suave, well-dressed, & knowledgeable as older men. I'm tired of seeing women my age used as nothing more than comic relief. Having Rene Russo as the sole older woman who is sane doesn't balance out the other 3. I also felt that the movie didn't need a really late (story-wise) plot twist. Overall, an enjoyable movie. DeNiro's performance shows he can do comedy as well as he can do drama & I didn't want to kill Anne Hathaway 5 minutes in, so she did fine too. The young actress playing her daughter is adorable & I would be crushing on the other men in the picture if only they'd shave, tuck in their shirts, & dress sharply.",3.5,"Sep 27, 2015"

,"After reading all of the so-so reviews of this movie, I had gauged my expectations, and was delighted to see a fun, ironic and (at times) a film with deep insightsespecially into what amount to Horatio Alger stories with a woman playing the head of a start-up dot com. The idea that ""she can do it all""-- family, mom, wife and company head is not so much challenged (any more than it would be for a man), but placed into focus. In the 1950s-60s, the nose-to-the-grindstone man in the gray flannel suit was seen as a person whose family was ignored at the expense of attention to his family. This film is refreshing in that it recognizes that concentrating on work over family is not a mortal sin and any problems with spouse and child cannot to blamed on the Type A personality in the family regardless of gender. Robert De Niro is perfect. At 70 he is retired and bored, but he doesn't come across either as a fuddy-duddy Luddite or a swinging grandpa. Keeping in mind that the De Niro character was in his 30s when personal computers came on the scene in early 1980s and just 40 when the Mac was released in 1984, computer technology in the home and office is not exactly new. Getting used a new type of interface or program does take time, but it is no longer the mystery box it was at one time to the older generation. This is a much more intelligent (and fun) movie than I expected; so, if you plan to go 1) lower your expectations 2) pay attention, and 3) enjoy!",5.0,"Sep 27, 2015"

,"I liked the concept of the movie. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathway have a great chemistry as colleagues. My only critiques of the movie is the way that the ending was handled and the development of De Niro's character. It seemed like the director left a significant number of scenes on the cutting room floor towards the end to cut the length of the movie. More could have been done with De Niro's character in terms of his experience to help the young CEO as a trusted adviser. You seem a glimpse of that angle when De Niro's character does some brief business analysis. Overall, it was a good movie that I'd own on DVD.

Myers is exceptional at attracting top rate talent to her movies (See, DeNiro and Hathaway for this one; Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin for ""Complicated"" and Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton for ""Give."") She also gets excellent performances from the talent. The story casting and story telling fall down a bit on this one. Myers seems not really to know how to get a story to the end, a failing the other two movies had as well. That said, you will greatly enjoy the relationship between DeNiro and Hathaway. DeNiro's relationship with some younger male interns (young enough to be his grandsons) is also very funny.

,"3.5/5* or 7.5/10 Being a gentleman, having true class, women empowerment, how life doesn't end after a certain age and how to deal with real life relationships are all things a film like The Intern deals with. The Intern is the definition of feel good cinema, I can guarantee you that throughout the film you will be smiling, and there so many instances the film is just so heart touching.But what really works for the film is the lead cast of Robert D'Niro who is only getting better with age, and Anne Hathaway who is epitome of really beauty. There chemistry is just perfect. Story wise the film talks about a 70 year old man named Ben, he is officially retired, and is a widower. After traveling the globe for awhile, he is back home and hates thinking about living at home all day,so he keeps himself busy all the time, sometimes he goes to visit his kids, or goes to starbucks etc. Until one day he learns of a opportunity to become a senior Intern at a online fashion company, and he pounces at the opportunity. He eventually gets the job, and meets the owner of the company Jules. Jules is a young but busy women running a company by herself, and she has a family which her stay at home husband runs. How the not so tech savy senior intern Ben comes into Jules's life and helps her in her journey is what the film is about. Acting wise, I must say Robert D'Niro steals the show, his character is so well written, and he embodies the traits of being a classy gentleman wonderfully. Anne Hathaway looks so beautiful, but more importantly gives a superb,mature act.The rest of supporting cast has done a great job, and is casted perfectly. The Intern is a movie made for a mature audience, and while the film has many laughs, the films undertone meanings are what really win your heart. I truly loved how the film dealt with the message of women empowerment in such a fresh but beautiful way. And one of the films major assets was how the character of Robert D'Niro was written, how even after being 70 he is still enjoying his life to the fullest, and how he is a true gentleman. I mean for me the film really didn't have any negatives other than the place slackened a bit towards the end Overall The Intern is not a pathbreaking film, but the film truly lived up to its amazing trailer.Its nice to see a film deal with real life situations, in a beautiful, light manner and not be so serious and sad. Its a film I throughly enjoyed without any hiccups, and its a film I highly recommend, you get your tickets worth in just seeing the chemistry between D'Niro and Hathaway. 3.5/5* or 7.5/10",3.5,"Sep 25, 2015"

patty l g,"+Anne Hathaway glows in ""The Intern"" whether she is leading 200+ employees of a company she founded or getting drunk and throwing up into a dumpster or crying when she has been betrayed or any of the many emotions she experiences in this 2 hour movie. On the other hand it is time Robert De Niro gave up broad comedies as he is only repeating every movement and mugging face he has made since ""Analyze This"", ""Meet The Parents"" and ""Meet The Frockers"". He has made many comedies throughout his career but for the past decade and a half it seems he wants to be Jerry Lewis! For a comedy ""The Intern"" is only mildly amusing with the funniest scene having nothing to do with advancing the plot but a 'breaking and entering' mission, which was written, and directed, by Nancy Meyers who has had success with previous films dealing with whether a woman can 'have it all'. Most of the film was made in Brooklyn showing the New York borough as green and sparkling and having an empty parking spot for any in the cast of the film. The various supporting characters from Anders Holm as Hathaway's stay at home husband and dad to their very precocious daughter JoJo Kushner to Rene Russo as a love interest for De Niro--whew! No, not Hathaway! Among young employees in Hathaway's company Peter Vack, Andrew Rannells, Nat Wolff along with Linda Lavin, Zack Pearlman and Christina Holtan and others do what they can with the material given them. ""The Intern"" is a pleasant movie but drags in spots and touches on subjects without following through such as Hathaway's relationship with her mother.

,"Sometimes you don't need a film to try and change the world, make bold political or societal statements or even be shocking. Sometimes it's good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show... and smile. That's the kind of movie you get when you sit down to enjoy ""The Intern"" (PG-13, 2:01). Robert DeNiro plays the title character, a retired 70 year-old widower who has become bored with his life. After 40 years in the business of printing telephone books and then losing his beloved wife of 42 years, he did his best to adjust to his new life, and it worked - for a while. He traveled the world and engaged in a wide variety of physical and intellectual pursuits to keep himself occupied, but it wasn't enough. When walking the streets of his native Brooklyn, he sees a flyer for a senior intern program at a young, but burgeoning internet clothing company. Ben feels that learning more about technology and working with young people feels like just the challenge he needs to occupy his mind and his time. He applies, via a terrific self-made video (the company's requirement), and sits through a series of amusing interviews with company employees young enough to be his grandchildren... and he gets the internship. Ben ends up working directly for the company's very capable, but over-extended founder, played by Anne Hathaway. The senior intern program was her idea, but Jules is initially hesitant to deal with Ben personally on a daily basis. She's a perfectionist who's constantly on the go. She's difficult to work for and she knows it. She loves and respects all 220 of her employees, but her motto might as well be ""If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."" Yet, it's hard to resist Ben's earnestness, strong work ethic and wise, calming presence. After a little awkwardness as Ben and Jules both try to figure out how he can best serve his new boss, he ends up becoming her driver. In this capacity, he gets to know Jules' stay-at-home husband (Anders Holm), their precocious, but adorable young daughter (JoJo Kushner) and, most importantly, Jules herself, in all her earnestness, anxiety and vulnerability. It turns out that, at this stage of the game, Jules needs Ben's wisdom and support more than she'd be willing to admit - to him or herself. Her company is growing so fast and she's so hands-on that one of her assistants (Andrew Rannells) tells her that the investors would like to see her take on a CEO. This would lighten her load, but it would also mean effectively giving control of her company to someone else. She half-heartedly interviews people to be her potential boss, not sure that this is the best move, but wanting to do right by her employees and her marriage, which is starting to suffer due to the demands of her very busy schedule. In the midst of all this, Ben becomes a sounding board and occasional advice dispenser for Jules, a very helpful co-worker and kind of pseudo uncle to a small group of the company's young employees (played by Adam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason Orley and Christina Scherer) and a possible love interest for the company's full-time in-house masseuse (Rene Russo). Ben is at the story's center, but it's the great mix of interesting characters and subplots that makes this movie so worthwhile. DeNiro has rarely been more pleasant to watch, or Hathaway so winning, as they lead an ensemble cast that complements each other wonderfully. Nancy Myers' amusing and purposeful script and direction highlight the virtues of women making the most of their lives, but never hits us over the head with her message. Jules is simply a modern woman who's very likeable and subtly inspiring. A scene in which some of Jules' employees break the law to help her with a pressing personal problem is fun, but seems misplaced, and the resolutions to some of the story's conflicts seem a little trite, but, overall, this is simply a delightful film that I'd recommend to anyone. ""The Intern"" isn't perfect, but is definitely worth having around. ""A-""",4.0,"Sep 25, 2015"
matt t,"The Intern is a simple, predictable movie--an old gentleman who wants a life meets a young person who is lost, and they eventually sort things out with some tears on the side. However, that's one of the major factor that made me like this movie. It's charming, cute, makes you laugh, and these things never get old. I know this might get some criticism for its cheesiness and its simplicity, but it's a good drama movie that makes you smile (probably what it's meant to do) and, honestly, I don't really expect much more in this area.

,"Ah, Nancy! For years now (in films like ""What Women Want,"" ""The Holiday"" and ""It's Complicated""), you have been writing and directing films that put women front and center - professional women, with impressive credentials - only to undermine the power of that image with a strange brand of (unintentional?) misogyny. On the surface, your films look, at first, like feminist confections, but then you always end up trafficking in the worst kind of feminine stereotypes. No matter what their strengths and achievements, your protagonists are inevitably emotional, irrational, and in need of a man to make things right. Even a career woman needs love, no matter what the cost, you always remind us. At least in ""Something's Gotta Give"" - my favorite of yours - you bring the man down a peg as much as the woman. How broadminded of you ... In ""The Intern,"" Meyers turns things around (a bit), taking the perfect man and turning him into good ole Dad - or, at least, a father figure - in the form of Robert De Niro, who once wowed the world with his kinetic energy in films like ""Taxi Driver,"" and now spends his time mugging for the camera in films like ""Last Vegas"" (and ""The Intern""). De Niro plays 70-ish Ben, who was once an executive at a phonebook (remember those?) company and is now a retired widower in need of something to fill his days. When he sees a flyer advertising a ""senior intern"" program at a local (Brooklyn, NY) e-commerce company, he jumps at the chance to apply, just to have something to do. The movie opens with Ben recording his application video, intercut with a montage of his present-day life, which includes a trip to San Francisco to see his son and grandchildren and, back home, an awkward exchange with a local widow - played by a very funny, if under-utilized, Linda Lavin (of ""Alice"" fame) - who has her own plan for how to cure Ben's loneliness. Lo and behold, the company - an internet fashion retailer called ""About the Fit"" - calls Ben in, and he gets the gig. If it all seems a bit easy, it is, helped along by the usual easy-listening soundtrack of composer Theodore Shapiro (""We're the Millers""). Still, De Niro, hamminess aside, is pleasant enough to watch, and there are a few gags that score. So what is a ""senior intern"" to do? Well, no one knows, really, least of all the founder and CEO of the company, 30-ish Jules - played by Anne Hathaway (""Interstellar"") with her usual spunk - but Ben is assigned to her, anyway. She ignores him, until Ben makes himself so indispensable to the entire office (he's that just that kind of guy) that she just has to take notice, and before long he is driving her to and from work, watching her kid, and spending time in her (amazing) Brooklyn brownstone with house-husband (sorry, ""stay-at-home dad,"" as Jules corrects Ben) Matt - a very forgettable Anders Holm (""Unexpected""). And why does Jules - successful internet mogul that she is - need and respond to this new older masculine presence? Well, it turns out that all is not perfect at home or at work: she never sees hubby, and when she does, they're both too tired to talk or get it on; she can't spend even the minimal time with her daughter that she should; and her investors think she should take on a ""real"" (male) CEO to allow her to work less and focus on the company's vision. Since what we see on the screen kind of supports these facts and assessments of her performance (maybe not the male CEO part), it's hard not to agree that, yes, she needs help. And with Ben so competent, he's just the fellow to save the day. It's all relatively harmless, and occasionally touching and funny, but all to often it's just a little regressive for my taste. Ben even finds a more appropriate - for Meyers' taste - love interest in the form of the beautiful office masseuse played by Rene Russo (Nightcrawler), charming as ever, and, of course, 11 years younger than Ben (Lavin's character is just too old and pushy). If the film were 30 minutes shorter and with all of the exposition cut out - Ben to Jules, ""You can do it on your own"" - it might be more watchable and I might forgive it its faults in the breezy rush to the finish line. But so often, it's a bit of a slog. Then again, if you've loved every other Nancy Meyers film, then you might be used to her aesthetic and not mind any of it. If so, then go see it in the full confidence that the director is true to her own legacy. ",2.0,"Sep 25, 2015"

,"Father of the Bride 1 & 2, The Parent Trap, What Woman Want and Something's Gotta Give. Some of my favorite feel-good/rom-com films from the past. They all have one thing in common, they're directed by the great Nancy Meyers. Meyers is one of the director's that every time she releases a film I'm always super excited to check it out because it could become a Nancy Meyers classic like the films listed above. Is this a Nancy Meyers classic? Yes and No. First off I must start by saying I enjoyed this film. It's a funny, charming and breezy. The performances by De Niro, Hathaway and Rene Russo are great, and kudos to Meyers for bringing out a solid performance out of De Niro that shows that he can still be great when he tries. The film also looks nice and boasts a fun score that's straight out of the '90s. It was heartfelt, inspiring and surprising at times and then at other times the film gets lost tonally and suffers ""at times"" because of it. There's something so great about seeing a film that has a strong female lead and showcases female empowerment in such an honest and relatable way. Also a film that shows that no matter your age you never lose your value. Even though the film veers off its familiar but enjoyable path from time-to-time, and I'm sorry Workaholics fans but Anders Holm was so miscast and delivered the worst performance I've probably seen all year. And also the ending is so abrupt and story lines are left in limbo and never wrapped up. SO, besides a few glaring negatives and some major and minor bumps in the road this is still an enjoyable at times and I can see certain audience members being very moved and uplifted by it especially if they can relate to the characters. Also, the film introduces JoJo Kushner in her first ever theatrical movie role and she just might be the cutest child actor ever that had great chemistry and line delivery, I'm sure we'll be seeing more from her in the future. Overall, I'll just barely give THE INTERN a 6 out of 10. It's a decent matinee film and if you're a Nancy Meyers fan there will be enough familiarity there to enjoy. Just don't pay too much for it and expect a Nancy Meyers classic and you'll be film.",3.0,"Sep 25, 2015"

,By far the BEST chic flic movie I've seen all year!,5.0,"Sep 24, 2015"
,"This is mostly harmless, emphasis on that first word. This is a typical Nancy Meyers film. Basic plot you can probably guess from the trailer: DeNiro comes in on the plot contrivance of an older intern program, and ends up helping Hatheway overcome her stress from running her company and trying to maintain her family life with a stay-at-home dad, with the main conflict being whether or not she'll hire an experienced CEO to help run the company. What follows is often amusing albeit a pretty standard plot, which is reasonably well acted, and charming enough that you can probably tell if you'll like the movie just from the trailer. Now, about that emphasis: two elements of this film made me cringe, and I'm not talking about the occasional joke that didn't work for me. The first is that at one point DeNiro and some of the other interns commit a felony, with Hatheway's knowledge and endorsement, in order to save her some embarrassment from her mother. Is this supposed to show she's competent at running her company? The mother character is completely superfluous to the plot; she's only there to be a nag on the phone, is never seen, and could have easily been written out of the plot. The second I won't get into too much detail about, but suffice to say it's presented as being empowering to Hatheway but instead came off, to me, as trite, cliche, and disempowering and playing to stereotypes. In other words: typical Nancy Meyers. Ugh. If that bothers you less than me, then you may have fun with this. Personally, those bits that bothered me could have been cut or reshaped, giving a shorter runtime (2 hours is pushing it for what is essentially a comedy), leading to a slightly above middling score.",2.5,"Sep 24, 2015"

It shows that even though they may be a difference in generation, there are some things that we can relate to, young and old. It had comedic moments which was great and Robert De Niro's character is so likeable. What I loved the most about this movie is how a women is portrayed. With films such as Suffurgettes and the last Hunger Games coming out, we need more movies about powerful women. Anne Hataways character always talks about how hard it is to be a women in the business world. People don't take you or your job too seriously. They also think that women can't run a business. This is something that is very important for me. I always try to break that stereotype and do something that I love whilst not letting my gender define me. It's hard at times but I get by. I love that De Niro's characters doesn't care about gender as well. He always cares about the personally. If the person has the passion or not and if they are good at what they do. Sometimes, the things that Hathaway's character does have some consequences and can make others insecure which is why she has a great partner in the senior intern. He advices her on the personal life while she helps in the business and technology life. In the end, I enjoyed it.",4.0,"Sep 22, 2015"

,"I saw The Intern in avant-premiere at the Ostend Movie Festival in Belgium. Anne Hathaway is a successful entrepreneur of an e-commerce fashion shop. Her husband takes care of housekeeping and their child and only gets to see her tired late at night. Meanwhile De Niro gets hired as a senior trainee at Hathaway's company and offers moral support when Hathaways husband is having an affair. Although The Intern offers a few good laughs and both De Niro and Hathaway give good acting performances, this is not the good tragic comedy drama it could have been. The Intern resigns to a simple moral tale: in the movie the husband is the 'bad guy' for having an affair and Hathaway the hero. Fact is in real life, both are victims of a very competitive society which means in order to be very successful, it often means one needs to neglect one's family. The Intern tries to be feministic, but in fact Hathaway in order to run her company neglects her husband and child (something men have often been accused for in the last decades). In stead of using this situation to discuss the impact of having a demanding career on family life, The Intern ends up being a simple good-bad tale.

,"The Intern is exactly what you would expect. An enjoyable dramedy with very little substance. I really enjoyed the performances of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. They have really good chemistry together. If they weren't in this movie, I wouldn't have liked this movie as much. The whole cast was very good in their respective roles. The story was ok. It wasn't anything special. You knew exactly what was going to happen. Sometimes, though, it was a little too melodramatic. The drama and comedy did balance out well. Overall, this is a lightweight film with two great leads. This is a nice movie to check out. It isn't spectacular, but it still is a decent film.",3.0,"Sep 19, 2015"

,"Bought this when it came out before seeing it cause I knew I would enjoy it. I actually love Nancy Meyers stories. The Holiday is one of my favorites & I still watch It's Complicated all the time. I find Nancy's writing simple & sweet. Even find the situations easily relatable. This story was no different. Anne Hathaway was awesome in this & I found Robert DeNiro absolutely charming & the chemistry between them was perfect. Their dialog was very entertaining. While the story has kind of the same elements as her other stories & people might think I rated this a little high, I just really enjoy these type of movies. Great acting, sweet story, funny moments & also heartfelt moments with some real life scenarios. If you liked The Holiday & It's Complicated, you'll enjoy this one :)",4.0,"Sep 18, 2015"
,"A ladies-friendly and gentle comedy, The Intern is a predictable, unrealistic and overly sentimental delivery which hugely, if not mostly, relies on the presence of its two leading characters. A so-so melodramatic, feministic story is told in a way which would neither annoy you, nor amaze you, but it would just work fine for a calm lazy evening with your beloved half during the cold winter. Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a retired successful businessman who cannot simply enjoy the calm life of being a pensioner and decides to participate in a senior-intern program. Soon gets assigned to be the assistant to a young founder (Anne Hathaway) of a super successful start-up in the field of online sales. Slowly, both of them have to learn how to work together, but also to learn to be different persons. Needless to say, the level of predictability, the lack of any climax in the story development and the completely unrealistic depiction of what the post-modern start-up corporate world is, damage the movie's chances to be taken seriously. Luckily for director Nancy Meyers, the presence of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro and the formidable chemistry between them somehow saves the movie from being a complete flop and actually turns it into something passable. As a whole, The Intern could have been a much better movie, given the record of Nancy Meyers (Something's Gotta Give), but in the end the flaws in her overall approach towards the story is partially compensated by the actors and the feel good final feeling. Watchable during a flight or in a cold winter evening with your better half next to you.",3.0,"Sep 18, 2015"

,"It's a sweet film. Amid the hijinks and coincidences there's emotional appeal of how some seniors can counsel, guide and astonish young people with wisdom and experience of the past.

We will definitely recommend The Intern to many others.",4.5,"Sep 18, 2015"
,"THE INTERN Review The Intern is a comedy that everyone can enjoy. It features refreshingly likeable characters, a charming story, and a lot of gut-busting humor. This movie is a story of a fish out of water story, of friendship, relationships, working in business, and the challenges and advantages that the classic ""age gap"" presents. Strangely, the movie feels like it would be a dime-a-dozen romantic comedy if the two characters were closer in age. But this is just one way that this film feels fresh as the plot, characters, and situations don't feel overly forced. There is a mix of old and new that works well here because, as we know, experience never gets old. In modern Brooklyn Robert De Niro stars as Ben Whitaker who, as a 70 year old widower, chooses in his retirement to work as an intern for Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) the multitasking founder of a growing internet clothing trying to have success in business and family life. Over time they come to see each others value more. Both of the leads are delightfully likable characters and you want them to reach their goals. Ben's chivalrous and experienced attitude makes him the epitome of the title ""oldie but goodie"". Jules is a representation of the new age entrepreneurial business kickstarters who are admired today. The differences between these two is never uncomfortable and keep the audience hoping to see more of what these two will accomplish. All of the supporting cast are also interesting and play off of each other remarkably well. These include Rene Russo (Thor) as the flirtatious maseus, Nat Wolff (Paper Towns) as a manager, Adam Devine (Pitch Perfect) as an outgoing fellow intern who, like in all his other roles, needs to imporve his social skills, Zach Pearlman, Andrew Rannells as Jules' assistant, and Christina Scherer as Jules' secretary. After this, I really want to see Rannells and Scherer in more quality roles. The director, Nancy Meyers, scored a home run when casting this movie. Regardless of one's previous experience in business, it is easy to understand how all of these people relate and what the individual business struggles mean. The entire narrative feels modern and is perfect for 2015. As a comedy, the part of the movie that should stand out and make people want to see it is the humor. In the two hour run time the audience laughed out loud 125 times. The jokes cover all ranges of topics and are presented through the creative situations, snappy dialogue, and perfectly timed visuals. But the movie is not simply another attempt to push as many jokes as possible into 2 hours. As cliche as it sounds, the movie has heart, lots of heart. Ben, Jules, and the others care for each other. We learn about Ben's 40+ years with his wife, his life as a retiree, Jule's struggling family life, the other interns' personal struggles, and more. In some comedies I lose interest in the dramatic moments and am just waiting for another laugh. But in 'The Intern' the comedy is equally captivating interesting as the more emotional sequences. The technical aspects also cannot be overlooked. The production design gave each location a unique and interesting look. Though his work is frequently such a perfect fit for the scene that it is unnoticed, Theodore Shapiro delivers a whimsical and delightful soundtrack for whatever the tone of the scene requires. After his most recent work, Shapiro is quickly becoming a respectably accomplished composer for comedy (he is possibly becoming the new Christophe Beck). There is very little to feel unsatisfied about with the film. The change in tone is occassionally jarring and I was lost to a few of the jokes. But other than a few trite criticisms, almost any demographic will come away from this feel good movie smiling. 'The Intern' was among my favorite comedies that I have seen in the recent past. Work place comedies have become so common that one of the most beloved sit com TV series of all time was simply called ""The Office"". But here the performances and situations feel fresh with the new twists of the aged intern, family struggles, and contrasting lives. It demonstrates the value of experience, management, passion, leadership, wit, and carrying a hankerchief (as well as blinking - ""Jules hates it when people don't blink""). - A- Nancy Meyer comedy THE INTERN from Warner Bros. Pictures stars Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Adam DeVine, Nat Wolff, Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Zach Pearlman, & Christina Scherer and is out in theaters September 25th, 2015.

,"Robert De Niro rarely disappoints and doesn't here. But the film - perhaps unwittingly - reveals the ways in which driven businesswomen poison their relationships with spouse, parents, and children, yet nevertheless maintains that Hathaway's character is a victim of sexual stereotyping. It doesn't wash. If you kept the same script, but reversed the husband/wife roles feminists would be frothing at the mouth. As it is, you just end up feeling sorry for the husband, the ""rising star in marketing"" who gave it all up to be a right-thinking progressive house-husband. There was no reason why the career woman here - she WAS President of her own company, after all - couldn't have taken her tot to her touchy-feely office after pre-school and no reason why her husband had to sacrifice his own dreams. Good grief! What century are they living in!",2.5,"Sep 16, 2015"

,Loved it. Best movie I have seen in awhile. Not your typical love story of a couple but between two unlikely people separated by years of age. It was fun loving and taught you that age is just a number. You can find friendship anywhere.,5.0,"Sep 16, 2015"
,"B When walking into the Intern you should know that this movie won't get oscar buzz, but instead just know that's it's such a fun movie. The Intern follows this senior citizen that becomes an intern with his boss that's younger than him and as the film goes instead of creating a sappy and akward lover story, we get a brighly developed friendship between Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro that makes this film funner than sappier. Again, this is jusf like any Nancy Meyers feel good comedy but what makes this film such a good and enjoyable one is Robert de Neio once again giving such a great performance that his character is so likeable that he is clearly the one that saves this movie. Also Anne Hathaway was good but not great because in the begginjng she starts out being rude and a cartoony character but as the film goes on, you start to like her because you understand why she acts like that and how well developed her chemistry with Robert de Niro gets. Problems with this movie are that there are many sub-plots like Anne Hathaway with her family that you don't care about and other sub-plots that are completed and are pointless to the main story of this movie. Also that the story's structure starts to lose it's focus with it going on different kinds of directions. Lot's of funny jokes are in this film but also bad ones that keep on going and just make this movie akward. Also that the conclusion to The Intern starts to drag on when you start to wonder when the film is ever gonna end because it adds so much more content for the sake of making this film longer and just like any feel good comedy, In the end besides those flaws, The Intern won't give you anything new but it's the perfect family movie that will make everyone laugh, think about the film's morals and get entertained by. Nothing in The Intern is absolutely terrible, it's just a movie that you should go watch with a family and just have fun with it for what it is. Rating: 76% and a B",3.5,"Sep 16, 2015"

,"3 out of 5 stars. Nancy Meyers' films have a certain formula. Take a good setup idea, add some of the best star actors and have lots of top technical work like Art Direction, Set Decoration, Costume Design and Cinematography. By the 2nd Act, start adding the usual rom-com mechanics, schmaltzy music and a heavy dose of sentiment. By the 3rd Act, throw in some unnecessary slapstick and side stories that go on too long. End the film with everyone happy, a few more tears while characters learn life lessons, and close with lots of hugging. This has been the pattern with ""What Women Want (Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt),"" Something's Gotta Give (Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson),"" ""It's Complicated (Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin),"" and now ""The Intern (Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway)."" Not an awful way to spend two hours, just a very predictable one. In this case, the film is worth seeing for Robert De Niro, who has evolved into the genial senior actor of his generation with ""Meet The Parents,"" ""Analyze This,"" and especially ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which is the best film of his late comic period. His subtle work and skill with all the other cast remind you of how great an actor he has been for over 40 years.",3.0,"Sep 13, 2015"

,"The Intern is that sentimental comedy drama film that tries to have that heartwarming, feel good outlook as the characters are going through some career challenges. When it comes to these types of films, they can be predictable. Very predictable, that when watching these characters going through some struggles with their career and their personal lives. It is easily foreshadowed that everything will be okay in the end. The film starts with a 70 year old widower Ben (Robert De Niro), who is always trying to keep himself busy in retirement. He applies to a senior intern at an online fashion company, who the CEO is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Jules is an every day busy businesswoman, she is always focused on her work, and tidy when it comes to planning, and having everything done the way she wants it too. Jules is also trying to maintain her personal life with her daughter and husband Matt. Her husband takes on the role of a stay home daddy, taking the daughter and participating in all the events with her at school. Ben assist Jules in her every day work by driving her around, giving advice, and life experience lessons, and also trying to help her out with her daughter. When Jules is coming across a breaking point of wanting another CEO to take charge of her company that she started. Jules struggles can be predictable, and the film easily shows that every challenge she is going through will easily be handled. Ben is like that magical person that shows up, does the entire handy errand work to keep everyone on track. Sort of like a Mary Poppins ideal person. Jules personal life that she rarely has with her husband and daughter does open the room that her marriage is not exactly healthy. When her husband is having an affair, as Jules is almost non existent. Jules is under pressure, the challenges are not really much of a struggle when solutions were easily given. Making the ending of her accomplishment with deciding the fate of her career and personal life less awarding than it should.

,The Intern enjoyed the Story. You can't always get what you want. I enjoyed the costumes and was glad it ended in a happy ending Loved how different everyone was. The story was very universal and a family film for everyone because it speaks for everyone. Or speaks to specific generations. This did not focus on one generation or another or a male vs a female audience but was a good film for a universal audience. Everyone can get something out of this story. I like how this film starts in the middle of a story and ends in the middle and can continue right where it was left off. I liked how Anne Hathaway eventually made it back up with his husband. I liked how the costumes of the characters all clearly were different from each other and were used to identify who the character was. And this film mentions that how the characters dressed meant something about the age and era a person comes from. This film has comedy as well as mention specific and go cover serious issues. I liked how this film covers real life relations issues between colleagues between loved ones no matter their age and where people stand. This film has heart and investment in characters through character development. I liked it when the male co-workers did an inside job to brake in to delete a message email to Anne Hathaway's moms computer. That was just hilarious. It is a film I would but because It speaks to different ages based upon their ages. One age group are sex is going to get something different that another age would not.,5.0,"Aug 14, 2015"
,"Not bad. Not Great. Overall the movie captures what modern society acts like, they hit the nail on the head for all of those points. However, the movie was waaaaay too....plastic feeling for me, it honestly looked like a big commercial for Apple...Uber...Netflix and a few other companies thrown into for good measure, but Apple hit the head hard in this one, and I didnt quite like it. Other than that I enjoyed myself with the plot and characters, but the movie did seem to be cut off in the end, which disappointed me a bit. Overall, good movie, would see again.",4.0,"Aug 14, 2015"

,"""Robert De Niro is back in his comfort zone in this pleasant comedy from Nancy Meyers"" Movie Review: The Intern Date Viewed: September 30 2015 Written and Directed By Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, The Holiday, It's Complicated and Something's Gotta Give) Starring: Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason Orley, JoJo Kushner, Nat Wolff, Steve Vinovich, Linda Lavin, Celia Weston and Molly Bernard. Writer and director Nancy Meyers is like a cute little poodle, even though the dog performs the same tricks, she still loves her owner. Meyers' movies have become comfort food for female audiences. After making ""What Women Want"", ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""It's Complicated"", Meyers is back with another female-centric comedy. ""The Intern"" is a gentle and funny work-place comedy that works mostly because of the likable chemistry between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Meyers has finally put Bobby back in his comfort zone after making so many terrible movies (The Big Wedding, Grudge Match, Little Fockers, Last Vegas and The Bag Man). Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a widower and retired executive who decides to get back in the working game because nothing much happens in his life anymore. Even though he is in his 70s, Ben Whittaker decides to become an intern at a fast-growing online fashion company. Ben is assigned to work with founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), who is at first skeptical about him due to his age. Eventually, Jules comes to like Ben and she let's him become her chauffeur. Likeable and reliable, everybody in the work place likes Ben and he gets attracted to Fiona (Rene Russo) who is the in-house massage therapist. Jules is married to her stay-at-home husband, Matt (Anders Holm) and has a little daughter named Paige (JoJo Kushner). When Ben is assigned to drive Paige to a kids' birthday, he discovers Matt kissing another woman. It all indicates that Matt can't hold on to his marriage because Jules is absent all the time due to her being CEO. ""The Intern"" is a pleasant and charming comedy from Nancy Meyers. De Niro and Hathaway have great chemistry together and ""The Intern"" doesn't have the sitcom feel I saw from the commercials. It is not great cinema but ""The Intern"" was sweet enough for me to recommend it.",3.0,"Aug 13, 2015"

,"I was really rooting for this movie going in because I enjoyed Nancy Meyers' previous films Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated, but this movie has some issues. The first hour of this movie is a mess and worthy of a 2 star review with its cringeworthy ""old people are so outdated when it comes to the younger generation's lingo and work process"" jokes that just do not land at all. I may have smiled twice in that first hour. DeNiro is giving it his all and though some of the dialogue is not good, he does a decent job delivering them. Hathaway is fine too but also is given a really messy timeline of work ethic that doesn't mesh all together. The ensemble is filled with great people like Adam Devine, Andrew Rannells, Rene Russo, and a hilarious but small part from Linda Lavin. Anders Holm who I like didn't really fit his part well and I think they under utilized Rannells and Russo. The movie starts to get better in the second hour after DeNiro and Hathaway form a bond and work pattern together and have some really touching scenes. Overall, the first half of this movie needed some serious rewriting because it was as if Nancy Meyers was a 100 year old out of touch woman that just based the young characters off of stereotypes in other movies and it needed to be cut down because it got to its point but never decided to leave it. We get it. DeNiro is lonely so he's happy to do any work he can do around the office and Hathaway doesn't want his help. You don't need to spend an hour trying to explain that to the audience. The ending is a little abrupt and cleaned things up too fast but it was fine, nothing terrible. It's a good rental",3.5,"Jul 20, 2015"

,"Ben: I still have music in me, absolutely positive about that! The intern tiene a Jules (Anne Hathaway) como la CEO de un negocio de internet que de la noche a la mañana se volvió exitoso, y deciden crear un programa para que personas de tercera edad puedan trabajar como internos dentro de la compañia. Ben (Robert De Niro) es viudo, y sin mucho que hacer en sus días, envía un video para ser considerado, y es escogido como pasante. Lo inesperado es que a la final Ben sorprende a todos y logra no solo mejorar el negocio, sino le da una lección valiosa a Jules. Nancy Meyers la directora es especialista en estas comedias que te hacen sentir bien. Tienden a ser un poco idealistas, pero no hay duda que son entretenidas y siempre tiene personajes encantadores. La historia de hecho me sorprendió sobretodo en el primer acto, porque me encontré enfocada en Ben, queriendo verlo triunfar, y desde el principio es infalible. Todos lo quieren y esta ahí para enseñar lecciones sabias. El problema es que cuando la película sigue avanzando, nunca vemos un lado mas vulnerables o con fallas de Ben, entonces termina siendo perfecto, algo que no existe. En contraste, Jules quien al parecer lo tiene todo bajo control, es toda una ilusión, ya que al tener este negocio exitoso, no tiene el tiempo para estar con su familia y ser una madre y esposa atenta. Pero estas fallas la hacen alguien con quien puedes relacionarte.La historia de infidelidad me pareció que estaba de más, porque no tenia ninguna relevancia y no le agrego nada a la historia. The Intern es mas de lo que aparenta, pero no sabe bien como balancear el drama y la comedia. Se les paso un poco la mano en el tercer acto, ya que parece una película completamente distinta de la de la primera media hora, donde es un placer ver la relación que tiene Ben con los otros pasantes que son décadas mas jóvenes que él y tiene un tono ligero. Igualmente es una de esas películas que disfrutas, pero que no te vas a acordar de ella al día siguiente.",3.0,"May 19, 2015"

,"Hathaway & DeNiro lit up the movie screen. This was a sweet,Â enjoyable,and very cute movie. I would like to say it was a romantic comedy, but it wasn't.Â It wasn't a comedy. I'd say it was a sweet business-type family movie. At first, I thought it was exactly likeThe Devil Wears PradaÂ and Hathaway was the mean boss and DeNiro was the intern. But Hathaway's role was not rude and abrupt like that of Streep. Instead, at times the looked like father and daughter as the film progressed. Those two worked extremely well together in the film. They have the on-screen magic! That is for sure! There are so many funny scenes in the movie that I cannot narrow them down to the Top 3, but my all time favorite one was when Rene Russo entered and ""introduced"" her hands to DeNiro's body. Lmao! Talk about hands-on, if you get my drift. There was a twist in the film- but a good twist and NOT a bad one; it was so sweet that theÂ entireÂ audience said, ""Awwwww."" It was too cute what the audience said.Â DeNiro really captured and connected with theÂ audience in this film. People including me wereÂ talkingÂ to him as if he was right there with us in theÂ theater; people were clapping for him in certain scenes; it was just a very highÂ entertainingÂ and sweet film. Anne Hathaway was astounding! ReneÂ Russo was dynamite! The opening of the film with a special lady who was after Ben (DeNiro) was absolutelyÂ hilarious!Â This is one of those movies where all you need is the popcorn and the sweet sounds of your laughter because the entire castÂ deliversÂ that to you! I am laughing thinking about all the things I amÂ recallingÂ from seeingÂ the film! You will NOT be disappointed! Everyone brings it and scores!",5.0,"Apr 12, 2015"

,"The feel good new business model old people and working females can lead full lives film of the year goes to. Defintely escapist and ideal and doesnt show a lot of the bumps along the way, but the film strictly succeeds on another Hollywood trope being the likability of the leads in this case the gentlemenly senior in Robert Deniro and the eager if wound up Anne Hathaway who both deliver above the bar performances and dimension to the roles they were given. Probably will rank along side or at least close to Devil Wears Prada where the polish and the acting brings up a film and is escapist enough to check realism at the door and you ride along on the journey which works for this one. Surprisingly enjoyable,.",3.0,"Oct 19, 2014"
,"This heartfelt movie feature 2 genuine, heartfelt performances from Deniro and Hathaway. They both are believable in their roles. You tell they bought into this movie. Hathaway is the owner/creator of a new business, and Deniro is a widow who takes a internship at the company as part of a senior intern program. The movie puts old school values against new age values and the results are fun Deniros characters is an extremely calm, nice, non controversial man who cares about others well beings. He also teaches the youngsters about values and other things from his past. This relationship is very cool too see. The movie isn't deep in plot, but it does explore things life family, overworking, and challenging the norm. I enjoyed the film for the on screen relationships which were truly fantastic.",3.5,"Mar 5, 2014"
