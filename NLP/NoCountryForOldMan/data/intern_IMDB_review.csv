grantss,"Sweet, sensitive, thoughtful movie - so much better than I expected A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. The founder of the company is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom.

Good, and surprisingly so. I was expecting a farcical half-baked comedy about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern gadgets and work processes. There are a few examples of that but the movie is far more than a story about generational differences. It's more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too. There's themes of generational wisdom, not judging people by their age (or anything superficial) and making the most of people's talents. It's also a movie about starting over, and doing what you enjoy.

Moreover, it's simply a nice story.

Solid work by Robert De Niro in the lead role. He doesn't do bad performances, but that hasn't stopped him in the past from taking on roles and movies that are well below his standards. This is not one of those roles or movies. Sensitively played, and ideal for the role.

Good work too by Anne Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go- getting entrepreneur.

TheLittleSongbird,"Irresistible first half, clunky second half Love comedy/drama when done right, have liked some of Nancy Meyers' previous work, Robert De Niro at his best is one of the best actors of the latter half of the century (evidenced in 'Taxi Driver', 'Godfather Part II' and 'Raging Bull') and Anne Hathaway has also given good performances. So 'The Intern' seemed promising.

'The Intern' didn't quite live up to expectations, it could have done more with its timely premise and does have things resolved too easily (the cheating subplot in a nausea-inducing forgiveness/reconsideration speech) and characters written too neatly and cleanly (with Ben being very amiable and irresistibly likable if too perfect, Jules is the only one with any real arc). At its best though, it is easy to warm to and for the first half it was continual engagement that didn't demand too much but did what it said on the tin.

What makes 'The Intern' work is the two leads and their chemistry together. De Niro is just a joy in one of his best performances in recent years, while Hathaway is a charming high-flyer with good comic timing, succeeding in allowing character growth to a potentially problematic character. Their chemistry, for such an unorthodox pairing, is so natural and grows warmer without doing it too quickly. Rene Russo is good value though her role is not large while the performances of the colleagues are amusing. The only weak performance with a very flimsily developed and bland character comes from Anders Holm.

It looks good, it's slickly shot and edited and the locations and Hathaway's wardrobe are beautiful on the eyes. The direction is mostly controlled and the film goes at a sprightly pace in the first half. The irresistible charm and a script filled with pleasantly amusing lines and small scenes (such as De Niro turning up at the office in a suit, with a calculator and addressing himself, in a way that's very business-like, in the mirror that reminds one fondly of 'Taxi Driver') and wry observations and insight, taking care in making characters as amiable as possible while never fully developing most of them. The story may lack depth and be unsurprising with some dramatic short cuts in the second half but mostly engages and is charmingly frothy and lively.

Sadly, things take a downturn in a jarring tonal shift to a clunky second half though thanks to De Niro and Hathaway it's not unwatchable. Really admired what 'The Intern' did in giving Jules an arc and it was interesting to begin with, apart from benefitting from more show and less tell at how good she was at her job and such, but halfway through became awkwardly indecisive. The sprightly, feel-good and very easy to warm to tone of the first half is replaced in the second half by pacing that tends to sag and things taking too much of a melodramatic and schmaltzy tone.

For instance the heart to heart/forgiveness scene could have been heartfelt but makes one feel nauseous instead. The wry insights remain but the more sporadic comedic elements don't feel as well timed or placed. As said, Anders Holm doesn't have the same enthusiasm as the rest of the cast and gets lost amidst everything else which does hurt Jules' character arc when she has such a dullard of a spouse. The music score is nothing that sticks in the mind, for music that's pretty repetitive this was a problem.

Overall, decent enough film if one of two halves, starting off very well but later mostly goes down south. 6/10 Bethany Cox.", 6/10,"21 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Hitchcoc,"DeNiro Charms the Entire Cast Totally bored with life, Robert DeNiro's character seeks out a new career. He had worked out, traveled the world, read books, on and on. While he is relatively happy, he feels empty. He is seventy years old when he reads a flyer on a bulletin board. A rising company is looking for ""senior"" interns, that is, people who have had tons of experience who can be used as a kind of publicity stunt. Ann Hathaway is the wunderkind of a clothing company that has feasted on the Internet. DeNiro finds himself with no power, attached to Miss Hathaway, but doing no work. Eventually, by taking on some of the hard work and showing utter kindness, he manages to become quite the institution in the firm. His boss is trying to balance both her career and her marriage (and daughter). At some point, it is decided that she should hire a CEO and give power over to him/her. Soon DeNiro finds himself at the beck and call of Hathaway, becoming part of the family. This is a touching, but predictable effort. It's still a nice two hours and DeNiro steals every scene he is in.

SnoopyStyle,"nice pairing Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70 year old Brooklyn widower and a retired executive from the phone company. His son's family lives out of town. He tries to fill his days of leisure. He spots a flyer advertising internships for senior citizens. It's a fast-paced fashion internet commerce site run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). It's been a hectic 18 months for the married mother of little girl and she is reluctantly forced to use Ben as her assistant. Her husband Matt gave up his job to be the stay-at-home dad. Fiona (Rene Russo) is the company masseuse. Ben befriends everyone until Fiona starts to find him indispensable.

Nancy Meyers gets a bad rap as the rom-com has become a passe genre. This is not a rom-com but it is a friend-com. De Niro is a little too perfect as the magical old guy with all the answers and lessons for the young ones. This movie is a bit too neat and clean with the characters. Hathaway is the driven multi-tasking internet executive. The characters may be stock but the actors make them breathe. Some of the side characters have some fun. The big twist (not that surprising) does not really raise the drama although Nancy is trying to say somethings. It all combines to create a nice pairing of these two great actors.", 7/10,"12 out of 13 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

wembleyfm,"Surprisingly Intern-resting! Without knowing too much about the plot, I assumed this was taking De Niro down a familiar trodden path of another ""Fokker"" type role. How wrong I was! This is a very endearing, gentle and easily watchable escapade that sees an ageing De Niro being given an internship with an e-commerce fashion company and becoming surprisingly useful at bestowing his considerable knowledge to his new colleagues. I can't remember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly any flaws to his character. Hathaway charms her way through the film and there's a nice cameo from Russo as a love interest. A film that doesn't try too hard to be funny and comes across better for it.

moviexclusive,"De Niro and Hathaway's chemistry is a sheer delight, but Nancy Meyers' distracted screenplay in the second hour undercuts an otherwise genuinely entertaining start As far as on screen pairings go, 'The Intern' boasts probably one of the most interesting ones in recent memory. On one hand is Robert De Niro's 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, presently struggling to deal with the concept of retirement; on the other is Anne Hathaway's 32-year-old Jules Ostin, the founder and CEO of a tremendously successful fashion-based e-commerce company called 'About the Fit' or 'ATF' for short' who is presently struggling to deal with the demands of her investors while not neglecting her six-year-old daughter and stay- home husband. Diametrically opposite as they may be, writer/ director Nancy Meyers wants to prove that these two individuals can have much more to learn from each other than you and I can imagine.

So through a community outreach programme which one of her company's executives hatched, Ben finds his away into ATF as a senior intern after impressing some of the much younger employees with his warm sense of humour, his cheery can-do demeanour and proving least likely among his competition to drop dead while on the job (yes, we mean this literally). Despite Jules' initial chagrin, that same executive assigns Ben directly to Jules in order to set an example for the rest of the employees in the company. And as the trailers would have you know, Ben will slowly but surely overcome her reservations with a keen sensitive eye and an unerring professionalism, eventually becoming not just a calming ear amidst the day to day chaos at the workplace but also an invaluable source of advice for her professional and personal woes.

Just so you know, De Niro and Hathaway do not eventually fall in love with each other, so you can rest easy if you're wondering or worried if things would eventually get weird or awkward between them; and to put that at rest, Meyers finds De Niro a romantic interest in Rene Russo's in-house massage therapist Fiona and occupies Hathaway with the discovery that her husband (Anders Holm) has been cheating on her with the stay-home mother of her daughter's schoolmate. It is also in the latter where De Niro will come most prominently to play counsellor and confidante, nudging her not to blame her workaholic tendencies for her husband's infidelity. Oh yes, there is a message of empowerment and encouragement for all career mothers within – and a slap on the face if you will have it for their other halves who use that as an excuse to commit adultery.

In keeping with her recent movies, Meyers has eschewed male- dominated Hollywood stereotype by fashioning Jules as a strong, opinionated and successful female individual who can be a hands-on CEO to over 220 employees at her company while being a dedicated mother and loving wife. Her response to her husband's infidelity isn't to fall in love with a fellow co-worker or to divorce him immediately; rather, she wants to give him a second chance, believing that a re-affirmation of their mutual love for each other will convince him to end his affair once and for all. You may disagree – as Ben does – with whether she is being naïve, but hey it's undeniably still a strong gutsy move for a woman to put aside her pride and her hurt to offer forgiveness and to choose to stay together.

Meyers also has yet another intention here, and that is to quash ageism at the workplace. It isn't just coincidence that the company Ben joins is in the Internet business; as incongruous as his presence may be in an industry that arguably does not appeal to his age demographic, Meyers wants to let the young upstart CEOs of today's tech companies know that – as the tagline goes – experience never gets old and that there is something that the Gen-Y leaders can learn from their Gen-X counterparts. You can almost hear Meyers' own lament through Jules that the men of today are a far cry from the likes of Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford, and that just as Jules does, we will find something to learn from the silver-haired members of our workforce.

Both are equally poignant lessons, but perhaps not so wieldy in the same movie. Meyers tries to convey the latter first, and does so quite persuasively through a mixture of situational comedy and punchlines that are gently amusing but never by way of caricature – indeed, the closest she comes to farce is an 'Oceans' Eleven' like 'heist' led by Ben to break into Jules' mother's house and delete an email that Jules had accidentally sent to her mother. The first hour of the movie cruises by like a breeze, in large part as well thanks to De Niro's spot-on comic timing that he hasn't lost since the last sequel of 'Meet the Parents'. There is also much delight to be had watching De Niro and Hathaway break the ice between their respective characters, their dynamic sincere, heartfelt and genuinely affable.

Unfortunately, Meyers doesn't quite do the former as well, and the latter half of the movie sags as a result of a more melodramatic change in tone and pace. Not to trivialise women in similar predicaments, but it isn't quite so convincing just why Jules' husband would cheat on her in the first place and a tad too convenient how Ben comes to chance upon the fact which ends up putting him in a moral quandary.

And though Meyers' screenplay could do with some work, it is the sheer effervescent chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway that keeps the movie afloat. Both are equally lovely in their respective roles, and the strength of their performances is enough to make you forgive the fact that their characters are probably too good-natured to be true. Yes, 'The Intern' works best when it is a two-hander between its unlikely on screen pairing, and fizzles out especially in the last third once it decides to make three a crowd.", 6/10,"117 out of 164 found this helpful.

MaryM14,"Great concept! It's amazing how well this film captured the essence of being a millennial brand. The craziness, and hectic behind- the-scenes life of the online startups that we see pop in our Instagram feed daily. I actually love Anne Hathaway in this business woman roll. Also the movie will make you like Robert De Niro, as he plays a kind gentlemanly retiree. I never get to see De Niro in this type of roll (due to me usually not liking any movie he's in) but he's so admirable in this movie and I couldn't imagine anyone playing it better. I love how the movie shows some of the struggles and prejudice a female founder/CEO can face without portraying Anne's character as whiny or completely incapable of running her own company.

Ricardo-36,"Good premise, flawed execution The Intern is what I call a ""paint by the numbers"" film. It hits all the necessary notes for this sort of comedy but misses the point of what a movie is supposed to be, like a paint by the numbers painting misses the point of art. It's like a robot has got the premise, seen a lot of comedy/drama-ish feel good films like Driving Miss Daisy, Devil Wears Prada, etc, and decided to spit out a screenplay. It doesn't work, and what does work, is sustained by the actors performances.

The main problem with the film is the lack of structure. The main protagonist is Ben, at least, that's what the audience is supposed to be led to believe. His life starts the film, he is the one that leads the audience to the situation, but he has no flaws. He has no dilemma. He has absolutely no character arc. He is a widower with too much free time and sort of has a void to be filled, I guess? He doesn't seem to be suffering, and all of his problems are solved at the first 5 minutes. Done. What is his change after that? Nothing. He is a perfect gentleman who does not learn anything in particular, does not grow, has no epiphany or real change. He is a mentor figure, he is not a protagonist.

Jules is the protagonist, but I guess the director did not know that fact. She sort of has a character arc, but it goes by so awkwardly it's just confusing. She has problems with her marriage, which are sort of represented by her husband sleeping when she wants to have sex. She seems to have trouble managing the company, but characters SAY she is having trouble, we don't see it. We have no sense of urgency, no crisis, characters SAY she has trouble managing it all. First rule of film media is: SHOW, don't tell.

Then there's the whole husband cheating subplot that was sort of created to add tension and drama, but falls so flat it's unbelievable. First, the audience learns about the cheating first, and then the protagonist states she already knows about it. Well thanks for letting us know, you gave us NO indication that was a problem. Second, it is resolved as a Deus Ex Machina, he just begs for her forgiveness and for some weird reason, she's just OK with it. I don't buy it.

Then there are the annoying minor characters that have almost no development, and the most annoying writing decision in the film: adding a scene where they break into the mother's home to delete an e-mail, JUST for the sake of adding a frantic, fast paced highly comical scene where one was needed. It goes absolutely against character! Ben offered to break into the house? What? WHY? He was supposed to be a down to earth, calm, wise man who would know better that Jules talking to her mother and explaining her feelings would be better than doing an illegal break in a mother's home.

Rene Russo's character is a waste, added for two reasons: clichéd, juvenile comedy (oh, he is aroused by that older woman, how hilarious! oh, the fat guy interrupted that massage and could NOT get out of the room silently, so funny!), and to just make the audience accept Ben was seeing someone else and would not, under any circumstances, fall for Anne Hathaway's character (so the hotel room scene is not as awkward as it must he felt while writing it).

Characters just do the most bizarre things just for the sake of hitting the points the movie wants to hit, and it goes absolutely nowhere. Does Ben get the CEO job he so OBVIOUSLY deserved? Nope. He just does Tai Chi and that's it.

There is no turn to a second or third act. The whole thing is muddled, confusing, paced so awkwardly you'd assume there is a real plot cut from the movie. Maybe it was a murder mystery, I don't know. The whole thing is lacking a proper movie structure.

Now, the only reason this deserves a 5/10 and not a 1/10, is the acting chops of Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro, who does NOT fake in an acting job as he has done for the past years. He keeps it consistent, keeps it believable, hits the tone and sells of that character. I mean, imagine Bill Murray in that same role. It would not work, because we would not see past the actor when the character is so low-key. DeNiro can do it because he is one of the best, he knows how to pull it off, and he does.

I am saddened by the lost potential. I really like the premise, someone older getting into a modern workplace, learning and teaching. If we got this movie's screenplay and asked for, let's say, Lawrence Kasdan to do one additional rewrite, it would be an instant classic. Oh well. Better luck next time.", 5/10,"186 out of 273 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jimel98,"Nice Story that's a bit predictable. OK, first and foremost, I'm sick of the pretentious a-holes who rush like sharks to a seal feeding area to condemn this type of movie. You blow hards go and make a few movies and THEN spout off your know it all garbage. GAWDALMIGHTY! OK, with that out of my system, this movie is a fairly predictable and pedestrian film. I have to be brutally honest however, a couple of small curve balls did surprise me, but overall, eh. Not a great movie but hey, a nice story. I use that word a lot, 'nice' and I've acknowledged that before. For some films, it's the best description. It's not exciting, it's not thought provoking and it's not intended to be. It's entertaining and at times, a bit uplifting. In a word, it's NICE! What the hell is wrong with nice? Not a damn thing. The whiney folks who feel every movie must have impact or teach a lesson or...what-have-you, are jerks, morons and probably failed film students who were rejected by EVERY movie studio, even the Troma Team. Let's be honest you egomaniacs, shall we? I'm just a guy who loves movies and in this movie I see a pleasant story that allowed me to sit for an hour and 1/2 and just enjoy a nice story. Is that so wrong? No, dammit, it isn't. Am I angry, yeah, I guess I am. Do I care if I offend a few douche bags? Hell no.

Sorry, I'm really ranting here.

Bottom line, Robert De Niro can do ANYTHING (and sure, it seems like lately he WILL DO ANYTHING!) and he pulled off this role very nicely. If you don't like this word, stop reading....NOW! He's a mild mannered good guy who wants to not be bored. Anne Hathaway has shown she can handle acting very well. I keep wanting to see more depth in her characters, but this movie didn't require much and that's fine. She's a good actor, not a shlub who gets by solely on looks.

Rene Russo. 'Nuff said.

The supporting cast do a magnificent job doing exactly what they are supposed to do, SUPPORT.

Sure, I found some things that I scratched my head at. Where did HE go? Why did SHE do this? What ever happened to....? But it's not a documentary, it's a nice (YEAH, NICE-IN YOUR FACE!) story that shouldn't have to explain everything. People don't go to the movies to have every detail correct and every single moment or event fit perfectly into reality. Take it from me, I can be a stickler with some types of movies, but I'm also a realist and even when I'M the one whining, I try to keep my whining in perspective. Some here do not. They think they're some important critic who's word will make or break a movie. NONE OF US HERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT! GET OVER YOURSELVES! So, bottom line, it's a nice (yeah, nice) movie that entertains. If you like simple movies that simply make you smile, this is one for you. If you demand perfection, make your own damned movies.", 7/10,"27 out of 36 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Platypuschow,"The Intern: Exceeded my expectations So I had no interest in The Intern, at all. The only reason I ended up watching it was because I was cooking in the Caribbean and needed a time out in a beautifully air conditioned room.

Now I like Hathaway, I think she's a competent actress but I very very rarely get to see her in anything as she is a very niche actress and only tends to do the kind of movies I go out of my way to avoid.

With her and DeNiro I expected at least strong performances and I got them and a lot more on top. The ludicrous plot plays out better than you'd expect, it turns into something beautiful and heartfelt.

The Intern is undeniably a sweet movie and it has substance but sadly it also has a number of overwhelming flaws.

Now Nancy Meyers is arguably the ""Chick flick"" queen and therefore I haven't seen many of her films. Based on this despite it being a competent little film I don't think I'll be rushing to see anymore.

Though full of emotional and thought provoking moments it simply has too much that plays against it and a finale that I had to see with my own eyes to believe.

Passable, but I'm not the demographic.

The Good:

Heartfelt

Well made

The Bad:

Questionable finale

Plenty of schmultz

RforFilm,"The Intern is a cute, even likable story about how elders may know more then you think It seems that in todays working world, the intern is the new entry-level job. Even with the great recession almost over, the millennial generation faces a new world of hard debt and technological competition. They also face a high number of equally qualified candidates that are more then willing to work for wage, and even for nothing, for the hope that they may receive an offer for a better job within the company their working for. My second job was also an intern position that paid nothing in exchange for experience. I didn't stay with the company, but I learned a lot about working in the Hollywood industry and even in an office environment.

Why are a lot of people willing to work for free? Perhaps with the way the economy is recovering, more companies cannot offer as many paying jobs, yet most people are still intrigued by having a particular business on their resume, with another thing to boast about. Who wouldn't want something like Amazon, Apple, or Google within their credentials? Tech businesses are the rage and everyone seems to be trying their hardest to get in just so they could say they were in. The Intern boasts it's own account of a trainee who may be a few years older, but just as able bodied and ambitious as the next guy.

Former phone book executive Ben Whittaker (played by Robert De Niro) has traveled the world and spent his retirement trying to relax and enjoy new hobbies like Tai Chi. Yet now that he is widower, he still feels empty. Rather then sulk, he takes a new kind of intern program that recruits seniors. His impressive resume and video resume lands him a job for a growing e-commerce fashion company that's in the same building that Ben had worked in for many years.

His boss is the positive, but still intimidating Jules Ostin (played by Anne Hathaway) who find that Ben has been assigned to her. At first, she assumes that he is too old to contribute a whole lot and give him easy work. Only when her chauffeur becomes drunk and Ben takes over that Jules starts to warm up. Ben engages further with her business and even with her family.

Jules in informed by her board that she should find someone else to act as C.E.O. for her company to make the business more professional as it had grown in such a fast eighteen months. Ben does his best to help Jules while she contemplates her decision.

On the surface, The Intern sounds like the kind of movie that would be easy to cater to older audiences with it's wholly positive attitude. For the most it is, but part of me enjoyed it a lot more then I thought I would. A lot of that has to do with Robert De Niro who still puts a lot into his role. It may be no Taxi Driver or Cape Fear, but he still seems to be saying a lot with how to relaxed the millennial generation has become.

Story wise, The Intern is nothing of a challenge; it's your nice story about the misunderstanding of someone's skills while making a friend. I'm still on board as the movie's tone relies on the nice chemistry that De Niro and Hathaway share. I'm really glad they don't attempt any hint of romance and keep them as friends. A racy art house movie might have taken on that notion, but director Nancy Meyers knew what her audience wanted. In short format, The Intern is a cute movie. It's likable and while not a hilarious movie, did manage to get a few laughs out of me.

I'll give this six and a half e-commerce sites out of ten. The Intern shouldn't have trouble finding an audience. It's charm should win most people over and maybe De Niro's points may get through to any young people watching.", 6/10,"26 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

patsworld,"The Intern is The Boss! Robert De Niro, as a retired 70 year old who re-enters the work force and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that oldies are still goodies.also proves just why he is a star as he shines so bright in this movie as to be blinding. He is perfection. There are some actors that the older they get, the better they get, and De Niro is most certainly one. Anne Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing company is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. And Rene Russo is still gorgeous as ever. I was impressed, also, by Anders Holm who played Hathaway's husband. But then, actually, I was impressed with everyone in this movie. There really wasn't a single thing or character I would change in this one, and that's saying something. The casting, the plot, the dialogueand fancy this, it was a funny, touching, enjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude garbage that usually just makes the audience cringe. It was well written, well -acted, and well presented. All rare these days where just the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt. This one is evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent out there. More movie producers should make a point of seeking and finding them! This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending to everyone within reading or hearing distance. One of the best films we've seen in some time and left us all smiling as we left the building.", 9/10,"89 out of 147 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one. It was very interesting to watch how they remind our generation about the habits which they are missing from the classic one.

De Niro and Anne Hathaway have excellent work chemistry. Director and camera teams made a great job too... Team work, thank you for this lovely movie...

Jerghal,"A 2 hour long commercial The Intern is a perfect example of the soulless crap Hollywood dares to crank out. De Niro plays a retired 70 year old who is bored to death and therefore seeks to work for free as an intern for a booming e-commerce company run by Ann Hathaway. The film feels like one big fat commercial (and it actually is). At this hipster e-com company everyone works on Macs, Ann drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster house. She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the label), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products are also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.. Even the music sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!). Al these 'people' in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the 'problems' they have are just first world problems. I also could not stand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly helpful nitwits. If you see De Niro playing this cardboard character (it's written that way, he tries his best with it) it's hard to believe this was the guy who played in Taxi Driver. The Intern is also so Politically Correct it's sickening. You can feel being manipulated while watching this garbage. It felt like these subliminal messages in They Live. People should not have paid to see this, they should have been paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial marinated in a forced 'feel good' message.", 5/10,"202 out of 378 found this helpful.

PWNYCNY,"One big cliché. Did anyone involved in making this movie really believe that this movie is good? This movie is so shallow that it makes a puddle look like an ocean. The idea of mixing a pompously acting Robert De Niro with a hysterically acting Anne Hathaway is an example of how not generate on-screen chemistry. Not that the acting is bad. It's the story. It's one ongoing cliché. It is a combination of dull, boring, and contrived. It's Father Knows Best meets I Love Lucy, except in this case the characters take themselves seriously. This movie manages to take several important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even worse, reduce the principal characters to clichés. A bored older retiree with nothing but time and a manic young business woman. C'mon! Not exactly the cutting edge of literary originality. And what is worse, they are not funny characters. The supporting cast is funny, but they are not the principal players. Now the story has potential. The movie actually starts strongly. The De Niro character is introduced and his issues clearly presented. Then the movie tanks, and tanks quickly. A promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale. This movie reaffirms the old movie maxim - never judge a movie by its coming attractions.", 2/10,"79 out of 155 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

CleveMan66,"""The Intern"" entertains like a seasoned professional. Sometimes you don't need a film to try and change the world, make bold political or societal statements or even be shocking. Sometimes it's good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show and smile. That's the kind of movie you get when you sit down to enjoy ""The Intern"" (PG-13, 2:01).

Robert DeNiro plays the title character, a retired 70 year-old widower who has become bored with his life. After 40 years in the business of printing telephone books and then losing his beloved wife of 42 years, he did his best to adjust to his new life, and it worked – for a while. He traveled the world and engaged in a wide variety of physical and intellectual pursuits to keep himself occupied, but it wasn't enough. When walking the streets of his native Brooklyn, he sees a flyer for a senior intern program at a young, but burgeoning internet clothing company. Ben feels that learning more about technology and working with young people feels like just the challenge he needs to occupy his mind and his time. He applies, via a terrific self-made video (the company's requirement), and sits through a series of amusing interviews with company employees young enough to be his grandchildren and he gets the internship.

Ben ends up working directly for the company's very capable, but over-extended founder, played by Anne Hathaway. The senior intern program was her idea, but Jules is initially hesitant to deal with Ben personally on a daily basis. She's a perfectionist who's constantly on the go. She's difficult to work for and she knows it. She loves and respects all 220 of her employees, but her motto might as well be ""If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."" Yet, it's hard to resist Ben's earnestness, strong work ethic and wise, calming presence. After a little awkwardness as Ben and Jules both try to figure out how he can best serve his new boss, he ends up becoming her driver. In this capacity, he gets to know Jules' stay-at-home husband (Anders Holm), their precocious, but adorable young daughter (JoJo Kushner) and, most importantly, Jules herself, in all her earnestness, anxiety and vulnerability.

It turns out that, at this stage of the game, Jules needs Ben's wisdom and support more than she'd be willing to admit – to him or herself. Her company is growing so fast and she's so hands-on that one of her assistants (Andrew Rannells) tells her that the investors would like to see her take on a CEO. This would lighten her load, but it would also mean effectively giving control of her company to someone else. She half-heartedly interviews people to be her potential boss, not sure that this is the best move, but wanting to do right by her employees and her marriage, which is starting to suffer due to the demands of her very busy schedule. In the midst of all this, Ben becomes a sounding board and occasional advice dispenser for Jules, a very helpful co-worker and kind of pseudo uncle to a small group of the company's young employees (played by Adam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason Orley and Christina Scherer) and a possible love interest for the company's full-time in-house masseuse (Rene Russo).

Ben is at the story's center, but it's the great mix of interesting characters and subplots that makes this movie so worthwhile. DeNiro has rarely been more pleasant to watch, or Hathaway so winning, as they lead an ensemble cast that complements each other wonderfully. Nancy Myers' amusing and purposeful script and direction highlight the virtues of women making the most of their lives, but never hits us over the head with her message. Jules is simply a modern woman who's very likable and subtly inspiring. A scene in which some of Jules' employees break the law to help her with a pressing personal problem is fun, but seems misplaced, and the resolutions to some of the story's conflicts seem a little trite, but, overall, this is simply a delightful film that I'd recommend to anyone. ""The Intern"" isn't perfect, but is definitely worth having around. ""A-""", 8/10,"45 out of 77 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

chaplinman13,"Pretty funny, great story all can relate to no matter your age or sex. NOT a romance. I caught an advance screening of this last night. The theater was close to being packed with men, woman and children. The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing. The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were various times I felt bad for De Niro's character, but he was optimistic and didn't let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of instances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in that circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We had De Niro's aspect as well as Hathaway's. Good storyline. The ""Intern"" group of guys were funny too. I'd see this again.

magnuslhad,"vacuous You have to imagine Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have their pick of projects. They must have piles of scripts sent to them. And this is the one they choose to spend their time on? The only intrigue this film offers is pondering the 'why' of that question. An IT start up takes on senior citizen interns because... well, the reasons are never quite explained. The older guys mock 'tweets,' and not tucking your shirt in. The younger guys mock a lack of tech savvy. Among all this gentle (i.e. not funny) humour about generation gaps, a bawdy joke about an inappropriate erection appears. Then some bizarre break in and escape from the cops. Meanwhile, a successful woman will inevitably be betrayed by the man in her life, the narrative tells us. Trite, unreformed storyline with one-dimensional characters: what did this A-list cast see in the script? Does Nancy Meyers have incriminating negatives in a vault somewhere? Modern-day Hollywood genre filmmaking at its most putrid.", 1/10,"70 out of 129 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

ferguson-6,"Cuddly and Feel-Good with some Laughs Greetings again from the darkness. A feel-good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars will likely have box office success and cause a lot of people to laugh out loud. In other words, the latest from writer/director Nancy Meyers should be celebrated for its entertainment value, rather than picked apart by film critics. OK, I'll give it a try.

Robert DeNiro stars as Ben Whittaker, a retired 70 year old widower, who just can't seem to find meaning in hobbies and the leisure life. He applies and is selected for the ""Senior Intern"" program at About the Fit, a fast-growing online clothing company run by its founder Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). In addition to being a Type A driven and obsessed with details company leader (the type that rides her bike through the office to save time), Jules also has a husband, a young daughter and a fabulous brownstone. What she doesn't have is enough sleep, any friends, or enough time to enjoy any of the good stuff. It's quite all right if a buddy flick with DeNiro and Hathaway seems unusual to you.

At the same time Ben arrives on the scene, Jules is struggling with her investors' decision to hire a more experienced CEO so that the company can maintain its phenomenal growth. That's about as deep as the business talk ever gets (but just try to keep track of all the Apple product placements). Jules initially spurns Ben, but of course, he soon becomes invaluable around the office, and while blinking his eyes, becomes her most valued confidant and adviser.

Much of the comedy is derived from Ben's interactions with the young employees. It's quite simply a 'generation gap comedy' that makes all the points it needs to make without really breaking a sweat: senior citizens are a wealth of knowledge and can bring value to an organization or relationship, young people can learn from elders (it's OK to shave everyday and dress for success)  and vice versa (computers are our friend), there still exists some animosity between stay at home moms and working moms, stay at home dads face challenges of their own, running a company is hard work both physically and mentally, communication often requires more than a text or email, and staying true to one's self is not always easy.

Ms. Meyers has brought us other mainstream films such as It's Complicated (2009) and Something's Gotta Give (2003), and she has a feel for presenting the upper-middle class as a punchline for the masses. She likes showing successful people in uncomfortable situations  leaning heavy on awkward, while avoiding dangerous altogether. Her latest is a feel good movie that makes you laugh, without causing you to think about anything in your life that might bring you down. And there is real value in that.

OK, I tried, but there are some things that must be pointed out. There was so much of Ms. Meyers' script that was begging to be pushed to the edge and analyzed from a societal aspect. Her specialty is rounding off the corners so that no one gets hurt, and because of that the film is bereft of conflict  the single most important element for a meaningful scene. For example, the conflict between Jules and her husband occurs in a hotel room, which would be fine except  only one of them is there! Also, we never really get any of the story from Ben's perspective. Instead, we are just to believe that his Gandhi-like influence on co-workers is the only reward he seeks. I also found myself bothered a bit in the quick glimpse we get into Ben's personal life. He blows off the advances of Linda Lavin and pursues Rene Russo  understandable, but a bit off-putting given that this female writer chose to have him hook up with the 11 years younger character, rather than the one closer to his own age. There are many other similar type issues that warrant discussion, but that's why it's best to just sit back and enjoy this one, rather than asking ""what if?""", 6/10,"21 out of 40 found this helpful.

cekadah,"2 hrs for a 45 min story! And that's no lie! Two hours for a thin veil of a flick. Two hours and when it is all over all you have is a sore butt!

The first one and one half hours could have been cut to just thirty minutes. Here's what happens - Jules, a young beautiful girl (Anne Hathaway) with a stay-at-home husband and a preschool child, has created a more than successful internet clothes shopping website. This is the opening of the story! While she's out of town and through a slight miscommunication a 'hire the seniors' program is advertised. In walks Ben (De Niro) a 70 year old retired widower, and guess what happens, he is hired as the bosses (Hathaway) intern assistant. She doesn't like him, then she tolerates him, then she likes him. What a thoughtful, charming, helpful old man he is. Then at the one hour and thirty minute point into the story something happens!

The final thirty minutes are taken up with her tears, Ben being the understanding grandfatherly advice type, and Jules husband making an ass of himself. All is resolved, happy ending, and 'you' the viewer will say ""Thank Gawd it's over""!

My final word. In the character development of Jules it's pointed out in a big business article that she does something on a bicycle in the office. How many times do you see her do this? I counted once, then never again does she do it. So why was it put into the story?", 1/10,"45 out of 88 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

dancing15bear,"A Good, Clean, Wholesome Entertainment Sometimes you go to the theater, and you cringe at some of the previews, most of which are full of sex, violence, and an apocalyptic view of the world. It's hard to find a movie that is respectable and clean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults. ""The Intern"" is such a movie.

Robert DeNiro is superb. How a guy who played such ruthless characters in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Taxi Driver"" can pull off this avuncular gentlemen is a testament to his craft. His Ben Whittaker almost seems too perfect, but DeNiro brings a humanity that makes him eminently believable. Anne Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet entrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon character of the Übermom. The supporting cast supports wonderfully, giving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the story. And the plot never goes where it shouldn't, something that does happen in other, more cynical films.

So I would very highly recommend this film. It has some ""legs,"" as evidenced by the fairly sizable audience given that it's in its sixth week of release. You know why? You'll leave the theater entertained and uplifted. And how often can you say that at the cinema these days?", 9/10,"118 out of 179 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

The whole cast is on point and charming. The high tech start up backdrop keeps it current and the tender story threads never feel saccharin. Two big thumbs up!

paul_haakonsen,"A surprisingly nice movie... ""The Intern"" turned out to be a rather nice surprise of a movie, especially because it was a really good story, and it was helped along quite nicely with some impressive acting performances.

The story told in ""The Intern"" is about elderly citizen Ben Whitaker (played by Robert De Niro), a widower who keeps himself busy as retirement proved to be not his thing. And one day he signs up for an internship for the elderly at an online fashion company.

What worked out in ""The Intern"" was the storyline and the absurdity of the situation. It is a story that was quite original and funny. But also the very impressive cast that they had gotten together for participating in the movie. Robert De Niro really carried the movie quite nicely and Anne Hathaway also held her own quite nicely here.

There was a great combination of comedy and storytelling in ""The Intern"", so writer and director Nancy Meyers really managed to create something memorable and unique here, proving her talent for telling an outstanding story with outstanding characters.

""The Intern"" is one of the better Robert De Niro movies in a while, and if you are a fan of him then you should definitely check out ""The Intern"", if you haven't already done so. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie and it turned out to be a rather good and heartfelt movie. It is the kind of story that sinks in deep and Sticks with you for a long, long time.", 7/10,"6 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

blanche-2,"a delight through and through Robert De Niro is ""The Intern"" in this 2015 film starring Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, and Anders Holm.

De Niro plays a widower, Ben, who isn't satisfied with retirement and applies to be a senior intern in a successful Internet company, About the Fit, run by Jules Osnin (Hathaway), its founder.

The very busy and distracted Jules doesn't remember even sanctioning a program for senior citizens and doesn't want her new intern. She has taken all the responsibilities of the firm on herself - it's her baby and she nurtures it.

In the beginning, she has nothing for Ben to do. However, that changes when he becomes her driver, cleans off the junk pile desk that drives her crazy, and proves himself the most popular guy in the office. When she is faced with marital problems, guilt over having a stay at home husband and her long work hours, and thinks the answer might be hiring a CEO, Ben is there with support and sage advice. He's also there for the beautiful in-house masseuse, Fiona, who has taken a shine to him, and vice versa.

This is a sweet story about what different generations can give to one another, as the kids in the office seek advice from Ben, and they teach him how to navigate the computer. They see a man who wears a suit and carries a handkerchief but has amazing wisdom and business smarts. He teaches them about showing respect - in one scene, one of the workers has to deliver something to Jay Z, and Ben advises him to put on a different shirt and comb his hair. In one hilarious scene, Jules realizes she has sent the wrong email to her mother (one in which she refers to her mother as a terrorist), and Ben leads the reconnaissance mission to delete the email.

Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are fantastic with great chemistry. Jules' daughter is played by JoJo Kushner, a gorgeous child. As Jules' husband, Anders Holm can show different feelings just by his facial expression. The company workers - Andrew Rannells, Adam Devine, Christine Scherer and others are terrific.

This isn't a film about culture clash so much as culture melding. There is a Dutch nursing home that offers free rent to students to live there. The result is wonderful. How I wish there were more intergenerational programs like this. The old are like fine wine - it's time to uncork them.

It used to be a Man's Challenge, but in this Postmodern World the Women are put to the task. Now there are ""Stay at Home Dads"", as We are Told They like to be called. This Writer/Director Nancy Meyers Geezer-Gal is so Hip.

alexdmtr,"Excellent. I saw the trailer for 'The Intern' sometime ago, advertised before 'Spy (2015)'. I liked the premise and the two lead actors, so today (the premiere in Romania) I had to watch it.

I expected a fun, neat comedy but what I experienced was so much more: a great plot, brilliantly executed and acted. The jokes and fun parts were on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic, immersive and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by amazing costuming and cinematography.

The entire cast had very strong chemistry between them, and both Hathaway and De Niro were wonderful.

Overall an awesome, heartwarming movie. I walked out of the movie theater with a smile.

mikipryor-1,"Who doesn't love Bobby DeNiro? Wonderful contemporary story, great acting. What more can one ask for? DeNiro totally inhabits the role of a bored NewYorker retiree who quietly, commandingly changes everyone around him for the better. There were little bits of sentimental predictability but not many. Nothing slowed the pace for long. It was lovely to see ageism front and center, blasted to smithereens! Subtle, believable performances that did not pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them. The boys ""road trip"" was hilarious. The ""boys"" themselves were presented as stereotypes but managed to imbue them with personality. There were some great laugh out loud moments! Nicely cast, well-written plot and characters. Go see it! Especially if you are over 60!

Davalon-Davalon,"Inexcusable I was in such shock after seeing this movie, that it took me days to be able to form thoughts that I wanted to express.

This is an illusion of a movie, AT BEST. At worst, it is an insult on almost every level imaginable.

Why should we remotely care about Anne Hathaway's character, ""Jules""? She created a successful business, lives in a huge fabulous apartment, has the cutest daughter that looks like she was created in a Hollywood test tube, and has a husband that is willing to stay home all day to watch their precious ""Paige."" (Nancy Meyers, give me a break with these names!)

What's Jules's big drama? That Cameron, her business partner (?), thinks they need a ""CEO"" to help them run the place better? This information reduces this supposedly powerful woman to tears?

Then... Robert DeNiro, ""Ben."" He sees a FLYER advertising for ""senior interns."" Does Nancy Meyers think that ""seniors"" have no experience with computers or the internet or smartphones? What an insult! Anyway, Bobby sees the ad, is ""selected,"" and shows up with veteran actress Celia Weston, some elderly black man and, INEXPLICABLY, Zack Pearlman, who clearly is NOT a ""senior."" These are the ""interns"" that are going to help out at Jules' business.

The ""black senior"" was OBVIOUSLY thrown in to honor some SAG ""diversity clause."" He vanishes after his 2.5 seconds on the screen, never to be seen again.

Then, the ""movie"" unfolds. Here are things that irritated me: Linda Lavin (from ""Alice"" — as was Celia Weston) is desperate to connect with DeNiro, but is cruelly dismissed the instant Bobby meets ""Fiona"" (Rene Russo), the ""in-office masseuse"". Rene INSTANTLY starts sliding her hands down Bobby's back all the way to his nether regions in plain view of everyone in the office. Because? Nancy must have thought this was hysterically funny, as she brings Rene back three more times, once in a scene where it looks like she's giving Bobby a blow job, when she accompanies him to a funeral (THEIR FIRST DATE), and once more at Bobby's apartment after they've apparently had the hottest night of their lives.

Next: the scene where Anne shows her ""factory workers"" how to ""box up merchandise"" is enough to make me want to join the Black Panthers, and I'm white! Anne stands, flanked by two white people, then two black people. Producers PURPOSELY put two white people next to Anne to make it look that they, too, were as stupid and dumb as apparently the black workers were, and that among FOUR PEOPLE, NONE of them knew how to fold a garment and put it in a box right. But Anne sure does, and that must be the reason she runs a big company! And because Bobby (without Anne's knowledge) SEES her ""instructing"" the ""others,"" he therefore INSTINCTIVELY knows that ANNE is obviously the ONLY person on earth that should be CEO of her company. Really???

Next: Why is it with all of Anne's great success and HUNDREDS of workers (all white; let's hear it for diversity!), that apparently her milquetoast husband is FORCED to stay home and take care of their precious brat? Why is it that they couldn't hire help? But, no, if they did that, they wouldn't have the next big trauma in Jules' life: Hubby is having an affair and he's found out by Bobby! Bobby who has never done a bad thing in his life. Who fell in love with one woman, married her, outlived her, and is doing nothing of value until he becomes Jules' slave boy, Paige's new BFF, and the Morality Police, making it his business to call Jules' hubby out on the carpet! When does this insanity end? Oh, and when Bobby drops by to give ""Matt"" (Anders Holm) a piece of his righteous mind, Matt has to tell him to ""watch out for all the Lego pieces"" everywhere. Since the man has NOTHING TO DO except DEDICATE himself to ""Paige"" and ""Jules"" — why wouldn't he have the time to pick up the Lego pieces? Wouldn't he himself trip over them? Or does he leave them on the floor hoping that Jules will trip over them, stumble and fall into a coma, so he can carry on his ""affair"" with a woman whose face we never see?

Next: Are you going to tell me that Anne Hathaway is going to invite Robert DeNiro to come into her fancy hotel room and allow him to lie down on the bed with her, confess her deepest concerns about her husband having an affair, and then watch some old Gene Kelly movie on TV? Even Bobby knew that he was supposed to keep one foot on the floor. This was so insane as to be laughable— not laughable cringe-inducing.

Next: The pathetic scene of Matt trying to ""make up"" for his ""indiscretion"" and ""reconnect"" with Jules at the end. BARF! Nancy does a close-up of his hand no FINGERS reaching for Jules' fingers and Jules BARELY responds. Wow, what a triumph! Jules and Matt are back together, everybody! Paige is going to have mommy and daddy and all her Lego toys and everybody's going to be okay! What a barf-fest!

All that said, I love Anne Hathaway and Bobby DeNiro AND Nancy Meyers can, ON OCCASION, do a comedic turn and do poignant moments. But overall, this film was an INSULT, especially to that poor black gentleman who was given a WALK-ON role to ""hint"" that, ""Yes! We have diversity in our workplace!"" — the audacity!

This film should be scrubbed from everyone's mind and hopefully we can all get on with our lives without continuing weekly therapy.", 1/10,"14 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Lejink,"Interminable This film was so sugar-coated, it should come with a dietary warning. Robert De Niro here is a recently widowed 70 year-old, bored with his life who applies for a senior internship post at an on-line fashion house run by its kindly, no make that saintly young founder Anne Hathaway who gets to cycle around her own office, as you do. Turns out old Bob worked in the same building for over 40 years and wouldn't you know it, immediately gets assigned to be her P.A. Naturally, she doesn't take to him at first, despite him making a hit with all the youngsters around him, sorting out their love-lives, accommodation problems, you name it, Bob'll fix it.

Give him a day though and he's soon saving Hathaway's life when she accidentally sends an insulting e-mail to her mother, making friends with her young daughter, giving her informal advice on the future direction of her company and incidentally, sort out her failing marriage. Oh and along the way, he hooks up with a glamorous granny also on the company payroll, employed, I kid you not, as a permanent masseuse.

I'm all for reducing age-discrimination in the workplace but really De Niro's character only lacks a pair of wings to make him today's equivalent of Clarence from ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Hathaway, too is just to be good to be true as the boss we'd all love to have, super- friendly, super-approachable and super-generous, hey Supergirl, she's after your cape.

The narrative just rolled by with a succession of mundane but sickly TV sitcom situations which sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly but always resolve themselves positively.

De Niro mugs it up unashamedly while Hathaway gets to laugh and cry intermittently as is her wont. The film could have been trimmed by half an hour and still seemed too long to me plus I hated the interminable light-hearted acoustic-based background music which is there in very scene.

I just found this movie a real insult to the intelligence with its stereotypical characters, predictable situations and by-numbers acting. And I say that as someone who is closer to De Niro's age than Hathaway's.", 3/10,"14 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

chaos-rampant,"Forced life If I ran my own studio and this was brought to me as something we made there would be hell to pay. A bunch of people would have to be off the lot by noon and whatever profits it made would go to finance a new Harmony Korine film as antidote to what we inflicted.

Why is that? It's a simple, feel good movie after all about an aging man, widower, who lacks a story in life and enters the upbeat world of a younger woman. They secured a lovely presence in Hathaway, DeNiro in his usual mode; two faces, sea otter smile or frown.

But it's such a cynical thing to take these people and reduce them in this way to make 'points'. It is feel good at the expense of all the other stuff, starting with laughs.

A story about an old man afraid he doesn't have anywhere to fit and he's reduced to nanny and chaperone and wise adviser of the young. DeNiro feels comfortable in the role or he wouldn't be here, as if he has agreed with himself actor-wise to be that person.

A story about a career-driven woman and her stay-at-home husband who abandoned his own career to raise family; when after feeling neglected he turns to an affair, the only insights we have is that he cheated and she shouldn't compromise her career, no others are really allowed her character. He is contrite by the end.

We would be smacking our heads at all of this, at the old man stereotype if he was black. We would be aghast to see a housewife reduced to this perception of her. It dismays. To see stereotypes we would like chased away from our storytelling come in through the backdoor as values?

It's social tinkering with roles, a bit like that Trainwreck. But indicative of the same tendency to reduce people as once plagued older films that we might would look back on their values as archaic. A revealing bit has three geeky twentysomethings lectured about men having been reduced to boys by a cultural shift as if this was a movie that was trying to see beyond reductions, but alas, restrained by how things really are.

Dan1863Sickles,"Really Not That Bad! I just saw THE INTERN yesterday, and it really wasn't half bad. But the whole time I was watching Robert De Niro playing the sweet, kind intern, drying Anne Hathaway's tears and so on, I kept thinking about a movie he made many years ago called THE FAN.

THE FAN was this great old-fashioned De Niro movie, the kind our hero used to make when he was really menacing and dangerous. He plays this insane knife salesman who meets this young black baseball player who's a superstar but is having personal problems. And then De Niro decides he has to save this young superstar, but when it doesn't work out he goes berserk!

The thing that struck me was that THE INTERN and THE FAN share an identical plot. And that while THE FAN tries to be dark and scary it's more often fall-down laughing funny, like when De Niro's character keeps bragging that he knows Mick Jagger and that they used to ""party till dawn"" together. Whereas THE INTERN is meant to be funny but is never fall down laughing funny, except maybe in one scene where De Niro leads a crew of young guys to break into Anne Hathaway's mother's house. (Really, it's much funnier than it sounds. I swear I laughed out loud at some point!)

If only kind old Ben had flipped out at some point . . . like say, when he finds out his adorable boss' no good husband is cheating. I swear at that point I was waiting for De Niro to become his ""true"" self again, and make the snotty young husband pay and pay and pay. He really should have gone all insane knife salesman on the guy. Or like in CAPE FEAR, he could have started bombarding the wayward husband with Bible verses and mumbling cryptic warnings like, ""you're gonna learn about loss.""

Dr_Sagan,"Hooray! for Nancy Meyers's generation. They did know better... Nancy Meyers is nearly 70 years old and this script seems like an attempt to prove that her generation had the answers for pretty much anything.

Baby boomers everywhere united! You are still needed to share the wisdom. Next generations are only to show you how your laptop opens and how to create an account to facebook.

I guess there countless movies like this. You know some ""back in school"" flicks where the old guy or girl returns to ""school"" and instantly becomes one with the ""kids"" and gives life lessons to the youngsters, how to treat a girl, how to be punctual, about honesty and fidelity. Next generations are just email-exchanging idiots.

Anyway. Despite the whole ""wisdom"" and ""life begins at 70"" crap, that are simply not true, you have 3 extremely capable and experienced actors (DeNiro, Hathaway, Russo) delivering the easygoing script and showing enough chemistry to make the film bearable. There is obviously an uplifting mood (the self made millionaire girl etc. etc.) but there are troubles in Paradise. You can't have it all. Success and solid family and be happy. That's the message here, although in the movies anything could happen...", 8/10,"53 out of 111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

A_Different_Drummer,"Atonal ... failed the 20 minute test Article Xii of the IMDb Guide for Top Reviewers admonishes us to ""move aggressively to correct misconceptions"" about a specific film especially if ""the majority of viewers seem to have missed the point."" It is a tough job but someone has to do it.

So here is the skinny. This is a terrible film. The problems with it go far beyond casting choices that some other members actually caught. The premise is terrible. Hollywood could use a really good movie that explores the business ethics between generations. This is not it.

The writing is terrible. This may not the fault of the writers, presumably they were following the ideas put in their head by the producers. Regardless of who is to blame, the script is soggy and lame.

The most reliable ""reviewers test"" for an unknown film is the so-called 20 minute test. If a film fails to connect with the viewer by the 20 minute mark, it is a dud.

At the 20 minute mark De Niro is still settling into his new job. There is no viewer connection or interest or suspense or pathos or empathy. A dud.

Rene Russo looks lost in her role and the scenes where she massages de Niro are embarrassing to the film, the cast, and Mankind as a whole.

tavm,"The Intern was a pretty enjoyable team-up of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway Robert De Niro plays the title character as a retired widower who works for a company run by Anne Hathaway who's married with a pre-teen daughter. There are some amusing scenes and lines but this was mostly a pretty dramatic take on ageism, sexism, adultery, and the eternal question of whether one can have it all. As writer-director, Nancy Meyers goes through all this with earned heartfelt characters as portrayed by De Niro and Ms. Hathaway. When I agreed to watch this with my movie theatre-working friend, I wasn't sure I'd really like it but it was quite enjoyable for both of us from beginning to end. Did things seem a little neatly-tied-up-in-a-bow at the end? Sure, but still it seemed natural so neither of us had any complaints...

He says, ""I still have music in me."" He quickly becomes an asset to the company and founder Jules Austin (Anne Hathaway) in a film formula way.

Yes, the light comedy is predictable. It is a good date night film and it does turn into a romance as I once heard ""All the best pictures are romances."" It is a feel good film that was well acted, directed, and written. One of the better of the plethora of films De Niro has done in the last few years And sometimes a feel good film is all we want.

It's no easier to pinpoint all the excess baggage weighing down THE INTERN than it would be to body-sculpt the average film-goer packing on an extra 10 (or 50), but one might start with they boys' home break-in caper. Next, Paige's all-in-pink birthday party visit never would be missed, and why not excise either the adultery subplot or the company masseuse--your choice. Furthermore, that endless just-hanging-out-on-the-boss'-bed-in-bathrobes San Francisco bit might have been aiming for some blend of bittersweet poignancy, but it comes off more like a creepy exercise bordering on incest.

madtrip,"The perfect movie The Intern .... The sweetest, most perfect And heart touching I have seen in a long time. Of course it helps that Robert De Niro is there but what a movie! This is what all movies should be.

Robert De Niro plays the perfect gentleman, the kind we don't see anymore. And every woman who sees the movie will fall a bit in love with him. Anne Hathaway perfectly plays the role of a successful entrepreneur, a working wife and mom who thinks about everything and everyone and still feels guilty about being a working woman, even after the perfect gentleman tells her He should not be the feminist amongst the two of them. Every working woman will identify with her inner struggles. The story is perfect, with the perfect practical ending, as life is always more practical than idealistic. The small touches like the housewives who look down upon the working mom and make her feel guilty (I have seen many of those), the successful aggressive entrepreneur's fear of hurting her mom, the stay-at-home dad's end-of-day exhaustion that the working mom does not really understand and the young boss' discomfort with her elderly intern... All so real. There's an idea here which I spoke about long back... The huge talent pool of retired people nobody is willing to hire. The intern's wisdom and practicality brings a calm and peace to the busy boss' life. There's a lesson here for us all here. Look at our elders and learn from them. Stop a while in your busy life to get more out of it.

Loved the movie, hope everyone of my generation sees it.", 3/10,"252 out of 368 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

rjsf96,"De Niro's Downward Descent Continues It's a sad thing to witness the fall of one of the all-time great actors. When someone like Robert De Niro turns up in a project beneath him like 'The Intern', you know they were only drawn to it because of the money. What's even more heart-breaking though is that when they take on more projects of this nature, they become less likely to be acknowledged for films like 'Raging Bull', 'The Godfather Part II' and 'Goodfellas' by general audiences.

Ben Whittaker is seventy years old; don't worry about remembering this figure as the film will constantly remind you like a nagging child. He is not enjoying his retirement. When a senior intern program shows up he jumps at the opportunity and ends up working with his bitter boss (a sickly sweet Anne Hathaway) she just happens to be younger than him.

I'm frantically thinking of something, anything to say that's positive or of significant note about 'The Intern' but nothing is coming to my mind. All that I can say in its favour is that it never comes across as hateful about gender, culture or race. But if I'm praising the film for elements it does not include, should that really count as praise at all? No.

What I can say is that 'The Intern' is as predictable as they come. You could sit there with a checklist waiting to tick off every cliché it indulges in. Chances are all the boxes will be ticked by the end. That is if you can make it to the end. This alleged comedy is over two hours long and this self-indulgent runtime has never worked any favours for the genre.

I don't want to sit here criticizing 'The Intern'. I would much rather praise a film than come off as cynical. But when a film is this uninvolving, dull and unfunny I just can't.

I trust you to make up your own mind about whether seeing 'The Intern' is the right thing to do. So I pose these questions. Do you want to see the fall of Robert De Niro? A comedy so inert and flat that you can barely raise a smile? An experience more torturous than a late night shift at work? I do not want to see any of these things. It just makes it all the more easy to decline this internship.", 2/10,"34 out of 66 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

SquirePM,"Humorless drama In its television advertising The Intern is made out to be a comedy of some sort, perhaps a rom-com, maybe a dram-com, but anyway a light-hearted movie full of laughs.

It is not.

The Intern is just a lukewarm drama with a very few laughs. What a shame. It has a story line which is rich with possibilities for humor. It could have been filled with moments of laughter and enjoyment. Instead it marches (at a v-e-r-y slow pace) right past many, many chances for delightful byplay between and among its characters. Wasted chances and wasted time. DeNiro was repressed and restrained by the director, so much so that this powerful, spectacular actor adds little to the movie by his presence. Again, what a shame.

It's hard to sum up my disappointment with this movie. 3 out of 10.", 1/10,"17 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Not funny or endearing. A depressed 70 year old widower becomes an intern? Everyone at the firm is a millennial who has no knowledge of anything human including the owner. Anne Hathaway's husband is a loser. She is too cold. Her firm is unbelievable. How did her firm become prominent? It sells clothes? What a novel idea. Best part is the shots of Brooklyn. The dialogue is really dumb and predictable. The situations come right out of a plot book.

daisukereds,"""Never wrong to do the right thing"" So, it's not a comedy. It's also NOT annoying. It's smart, but very subtle. Definitely crafted with a lot of care. Fast paced and straight to the point out of the gate. Doesn't let down, and it's interesting throughout.

It's one of those cozy movies that you'd like to be a part of. A comfortable ride devoid of real stress and drama. It's the little things and great attention to details, interactions and characters you'd find in real life with a thin layer of ""sunshine"" that makes them likeable. Both leads are great for their roles, and they sell it. With plenty of sentimental value, that is never overbearing.

I personally didn't like the ending.. particularly because I liked the movie so much.

jay-techie2007,"A perfect mood setter, feel good movie!! The Intern brings you to the life of a 70 year old who doesn't want to live an average retired old man routine because he still feels he has music (metaphorically) left in him. So he takes up a senior intern job at an online fashion site with a completely different environment and people than what he has worked all his life. He meets the founder and while working with her, becomes her confidant and mentor.

Story (8/10): The story is simple and very well knit. It beautifully portrays how a Baby Boomer generation old school veteran brings peace and stability to a Millennial generation woman entrepreneur lost in the crazy and excruciatingly demanding business world. The characters have been well conceptualized and sketched. What is interesting to see is how a rapid fire, anxious, no non-sense, always on top of everything boss (Anne Hathaway) works with a composed, experienced, twice aged intern (Robert De Niro). Some of the scenes really touch your heart, especially the conversations between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro. I won't reveal it to spill the beans over here. At the end, it leaves you with some food for thought.

Acting (9/10): With stalwarts like Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro, one doesn't really need to worry much about the acting. The simplicity of the story didn't demand high levels of acting either. However, Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro does a great job at projecting the aspirations, principles, beliefs and challenges of both the generations on one plate, not just in terms of dialog delivery but also expressions. The supporting cast does a commendable job too with the available screen time.

Direction(9/10): Nancy Meyers had struggled a little in her earlier movies but have learnt lessons on romantic comedy well and has got it right this time. The Intern is, however, more of a comedy rather than romance. While the plot was quite average, her execution skills elevated the movie to a different level. I like the way she focused on projecting the synergies of two different generations working together rather than the friction which we normally see. This gave the entire movie a very feel good factor. She could have got away with some of the characters which would have kept the movie a little focused but overall a brilliant effort.

Overall (9/10): I watched this movie on a Saturday morning show and couldn't have asked for a better and positive start to the weekend. This movie is a mood setter and yes, it does it amazingly well. A definite watch for everyone.", 4/10,"37 out of 76 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Plastic characters living in Pleasantville My main problem with this movie is that it has no conflict until the 1h:25min mark and even then the conflict is underplayed and quickly resolved with no effort. And since there's no conflict what's the point? Not even the greatness of Robert de Niro can boost this movie to more than a 4/10. All the characters are perfect, plastic people, and everything is constant sunshine. This movie should be categorized as a fantasy because there's barely a drop of real life in it. This is the film equivalent of elevator music.

ayushparasar,"Mood lightning, cheerful and real- A must watch It's a great watch and unusually real. You can easily relate to the characters specially if you've ever in life been an intern, you'll feel the nostalgia when you see Robert de Niro's Ben Whittaker all lively and pumped when he's selected as a senior-intern under Anne Hathaway's Jules Ostin. Like every newbie at work, although he is not, he longs to get some tasks and help his mentor in every way possible. In the beginning you pity the 70-year-old retired and widowed Ben for being slightly neglected or ill-treated by the workaholic, passionate, never tiring, ambitious and successful Jules, but that is short lived and He wins her confidence and heart in a couple of days.

The whole movie revolves around Ben's life and how he cheers up everybody around him all the time with his cuteness and wisdom. The actors have done very decent work and you can easily gel in the movie and feel the life in it. The music too is very jovial and sets your mood from the first minute of the runtime. The movie presents some very important aspects of the society in a very subtle yet effective way like how a woman is prejudiced at work or as leaders, how the new generation boys in the pursuit of being cool no longer remain a gentleman, marriage life problems etc. A pinch of comedy here and there adds up to the fun content, and a few personal life tensions of Jules balances it very beautifully and how She comes out of it is remarkable and worth taking lessons from.

Overall a very good watch if you're looking to uplift your mood (which is always, because that's why people turn to movies).", 8/10,"2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

fingazmc,"Shocked that I liked it This really isn't usual thing, I mean so far from what I'd usually watch, but it's De Niro so I had to give it a try... And I loved it!

It was so heartwarming and feelgood, which is exactly what I need right now (my best mate passed away last night at 41).

De Niro is brilliant in this, the man really can play any character, I still think he's the number one actor in the world, (closely followed by Di Caprio) and Anne Hathaway was brilliant as well, she played the stuffy boss to a tee.

I don't like giving spoilers or passing off a synopsis as a review (which so many people on here do) but if you want a good, wholesome, sometimes funny and just overall nice 2 hours then definitely give this a watch, you might even shed a tear, but you'll come away feeling better for it.

ayoreinf,"Good roles good actors, who needs anything else Once again, the movie feels better than it is. Because of the killer combo I refer to at the title. Every role is written here to perfection, even the tiniest ones. Almost every person on whom the camera stays a few seconds gets a well defined character. Good actors do wonders with good roles - I said it in my reviews more than once. So the story is riddled with cliché. Nancy Meyers does her share of milking the feminist agenda, as she so often does in her movies. But since we grow into liking the characters on screen we don't care, we don't even mind that they get the Hollywood way of problem solving, we all knew it was a Hollywood movie we were going to see.

Now, since acting is so very important to the likability of this movie, I want to add some more general points. I recently read a lot of complaints regarding De Niro's present casting a shadow over his glorious past. And I do agree that not all his recent roles were up to par. So many great actors who really love acting suffer from the same problem that William Holden, one of the all time greats once even said to a novice, ""take every role you're being offered, if you're good enough you'll be remembered for the best of them"" - purist will find errors in my quote but that was the gist of what he said, and he did follow his own advise. And so do many other great actors. And De Niro, make no mistakes, is one of the greatest, no matter how many mediocre roles he has down to his name. This one is one of his best roles in recent years, and he does it with his usual professional attitude and with his usual intelligence. No good actor is really stupid, to really understand the character you need to portray takes a brain. So some actors may be very shy or tongue tied, when they have to speak for them selves, don't mistake it for not having an opinion or not understanding what they're speaking about.

Apart from De Niro Anne Hathaway also shines, and I also have to say some nice words about Rene Russo, who didn't have a significant role since god knows when. The actors do carry this movie through the field of movie cliché, but they're all so good, it is fun to watch.", 9/10,"5 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

aharmas,"Wisdom and Heart: A Winning Combo Here's De Niro surprising us with a performance that is far removed from just about everything he's done before, and it's a winning turn. De Niro plays a retired man who joins the working world when he turns 70. Because of his background, he's kept up with technology and appears to be an old fashioned gentleman in an environment where dress codes are very relaxed and social etiquette is a thing of the past.

Because of his congenial personality, he wins most of the workers over, and in the biggest ironic twist, he's assigned to the driven head of the company, a winning turn by Hathaway. It's really obvious that they will clash, but he's a gentleman, and she does appreciate a combination of heart and practicality.

He observes how stressed is because she's dedicated to her career, and she tries to juggle her personal life, but it's an impossible task because there's too much to do. If one considers, that a marriage demands much commitment, and a company's head needs a strong supportive team, she's bound for disaster. But don't worry, De Niro comes and saves the day, and the best compliment we can give it is that it doesn't appear manipulative or far fetched.

""The Intern"" will probably raise a few eyebrows out there with its team of marriage trouble, but one has to remember it's a comedy, and its message is that anything is possible if you try hard to reach for your dreams and always keep a positive attitude. You need a strong heart, a belief that you will succeed when you pursue your true passion. It doesn't deny that life can have some bumpy moments, but keep your chin up, find yourself some support, and you'll come through a winner.", 5/10,"5 out of 9 found this helpful.

toadwriter,"a feel-good movie The Intern centers around an elderly guy who gets hired by an upstart company, which only seems to employ millennials. Apparently someone threatened them with ageism, so they decided to start a Senior Intern program --- something I've never heard of.

That to me is at the heart of what makes this movie great. I mean, there either are companies out there using the concept of senior interns, or this movie's premise is completely original and I love originality.

Concept aside, I imagine the script is a page-turner, because it's a movie that sucks me in and makes me interested in what's going to happen next.

First this old intern gets a job with young whippersnappers, he's assigned to the owner of the company, she wants nothing to do with him, but their relationship begins to evolve when the old guy spots her driver sipping from a bottle before he has to take Jules somewhere. So ""Ben"" confronts him and the driver takes the day off (never to return).

Ben ends up chauffeuring for Jules and later he shares a tasters choice moment in which he tells Jules the building they work in is the same one he worked in for 40 years.

There are so many good moments in the film that I don't want to rehash, but if you like feel-good, I'd recommend this. Manly men probably won't like this because there really isn't any ""cool"" stuff, but I've seen the movie multiple times and haven't gotten sick of it.", 10/10,"2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even though the main idea is brilliant, the script unfortunately fails to deliver. There are at least four(4) parallel subplots going on: i) the retired widowed executive wishing to stay active, ii) a startup growing too fast for its founders to cope with, facing the urge of installing an external CEO, iii) the romance the ""intern"" finds and iv) the price the founder of the start-up needs to pay in the personal front with the husband cheating on her. Apparently the creators of the film wanted to see the plot in its holistic dimension, forgetting they just had 120min of film (too much for a comedy anyhow) to convey it to the audience.

Jo-Ropke,"""You talking' to me?"" This is the kind of movie I (like to) watch when sitting in a 10 hours flight, it kills time, you don't have to bother about the background noise of the engines muffling some beautiful score, you won't wake up your neighbors by laughing out loud and it's so boring that you do not need anything artificial to fall asleep. Somewhere in the movie De Niro talks to himself in the mirror... I couldn't but see his younger version in Taxi Driver and for 1 second I was hoping that he WOULD say his famous line, then we would all have been reassured that it was all just a big parody, but he didn't (of course) and everything went downhill further along. Two stars nevertheless because De Niro does what he does best, do the De Niro and Ann Hathaway is not that bad an actress.

I love it that you can read every emotion from Robert De Niro's facial gestures, and his character in the movie. It takes you to the times of the real gentlemen walking earth. Funny enough, I personally also identified with Anne Hathaway's role so much as a young woman entrepreneur. It's lovely that they pointed out the difficulties of being in such position in life as a young, strong woman. An absolutely great movie made, so much appreciated. Cheers to everyone contributed!

thesar-2,"Internally Spectacular Let's begin with some very special quotes that I hope you'll catch the reference as instantly as I did:

""And Rachel? Have a great wedding,"" says Jules (Anne Hathaway) and ""You're calling me 'Ace?' That's like super cool,"" Jules to Ben (Robert De Niro.)

Truly, while I caught these, I might have missed so many more wonderful homages to these actor's other works. The first one, about the wedding, happened extremely early on and set the stage of me loving this film. In fact, I couldn't stop raving about it all day at work today after watching it last night.

I do like Robert De Niro, though he hasn't always been in great roles or movies and for the most part, he's played the same character. The 72- year-old actor might as well had his screen debut here. He was fresh, interesting and just perfect in the role of such an incredible character. I praise both De Niro's acting and the part of Ben.

While I also loved the entire movie, Ben's genuine senior intern stole my heart as he did for all the other character that rightfully flocked to him. He was playing a 70-year-old who I would incredibly proud to be like when I reach that age in (gulp) under several decades. He was smart (waaay smart) with his money for his retirement, he didn't let anything get him down, he was always curious to learn more, set in his ways without judgment of anyone else and most importantly, he always put others first. He was human and perfect at the same time.

Beautiful – strike that, gorgeous – Anne Hathaway also was very good in her role, though even with her beauty, De Niro simply stole every scene from her. Not to take anything away from her, as she wasn't just crucial to the plot, but she still gave 100%. The remaining cast, including the always lovely and wish-we-could-see-more-of Rene Russo, the always cute Adam DeVine and Christina Scherer, were all wonderful to watch as well.

Beyond the cast, the script, direction and cinematography all made the just over two hour film a breeze and never ceased to make me smile. It was hilarious, touching though never unconvincing and certainly moving with the example Ben leads.

Retired Ben did everything he wanted to early in his retirement, but when the freshness wore off, he was afraid to whiter away. Fortunately, he found a new spark as a ""Senior Intern"" in a completely opposite young adult internet firm. At first, no one, including Jules, knew how to take him, but good ole Ben, unintentionally became the star, friend and mentor to everyone there.

In no way did this movie feel unrealistic, or misguided to what could happen. It was so well written and driving, you could feel as if you were there in that office with him. You'd want to be there. You'd want to be Ben's peer and friend.

Another plus is that this was an adult comedy with minimal adult themes or gross out moments just to get the young men giggling. While I don't mind the crude humor films, à la Seth Rogen's romps, it was thoroughly refreshing to have an adult comedy that didn't need it, care for it or use it as a crutch. Like Ben, it was pleasantly professional.

This isn't just a movie to see. It's to buy and rewatch many times. I know I can't wait to see it again and maybe remember the good ole ways that I wasn't even a part of.

***

Final thoughts: Yes, and I'm sure this is true for many, Ben reminded me of my father. Many of his characteristics, mannerisms, old school methods and official politeness that my father shares blended into my life as well. I am not as old as Ben, as established above, but I believe I saw 100% of where all of Ben's habits, words and emotions came from. Growing up with my dad – who will be the same age as De Niro's character in a couple of months, I saw his life from where he was raised and what he was taught, right from wrong, how to treat people and even carrying the handkerchief. It was a nice reminder of my pop and maybe I should give him a call now", 10/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

juraj-jerkovic,"She is the centre of the universe Thats what the film is about. And everyone should adapt their lives for her hapiness and success and be happy to do so. And thats what they do in the film. Its a 100% chick movie pampering to present female fantasies about life full of unrealistic characters. De Niro was interesting in the beginning but than he becomes the daddy who supports his special princess girl.

And there was more than just one here, this movie had so much to say! So much that we forget about these days, so much that we need to relearn. Enjoyed watching this so much.

ccorral419,"You're never to old to intern! Director/Writer Nancy Meyers (""It's Complicated,"" ""The Holiday,"" ""Somethings Gotta Give"") returns to the big screen with yet another mature family fun film about a senior (the ever so cool Robert DeNiro) coming back into the working world of twenty-somethings and workaholic Jules (the always beautiful Anne Hathaway). Hathaway's character isn't far from her ""Devil Wears Prada"" spin, yet she understands these frazzled characters so well. Meyers not only understands how to present a relatable story, she perfectly fills the ensemble rolls with quality and memorable characters, including Rene Russo, Anders Holms (Workaholics - TV), Andrew Rannellis (GIRLS), Adam DeVine (Modern Family), Zack Perlman (Married), Christina Scherer, and veteran favorites Linda Lavin and Celia Weston (Alice) to name a few. ""The Intern"" doesn't solve any ""senior/retirement"" moments, but it does remind one life isn't over until it's over. This film has Nancy Meyers written all of it, and that's a good thing!

kdavies-69347,"Girlfriend loved it, I hated it. I watched this movie last night with my girlfriend (who is a film major), and she loved this one. I'm not sure what this movie was trying to achieve. I suppose more than anything it could be classified as an emotion film, but it goes about evoking it in the wrong way.

Robert DeNiro portrays the confident, hard working Ben Whittaker. Now in his 70's, he's retired and widowed, and in the position of having too much time on his hands. His life is stagnant and he doesn't really know what to do with himself anymore. Enter Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway), successful, confident entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar website/ clothing company. A savvy-minded person, summarized easily as a successful hipster with too much on her plate. Her company, also full of hipsters with less acumen put out an advert for a 'senior-intern' or rather an old person for the office work to make them feel useful. Ben responds, gets the job, and becomes close friends with the boss.

What I didn't enjoy about this movie was the over the top scenes that were just notably devoid of the proper emotional content. Ben becomes her confidant, best friend, and business partner in a few ways. The connection between the two is supposed to be one of friendship and understanding. But on screen it seems like nothing built up to that moment. One minute they are strangers, in the next moment best friends, missing any real emotional built up. Jules husband, a kind of out of shape former businessman, doesn't seem to care about his wife in his most emotional scene. It was watching an actor trying to cry really really hard, and I couldn't connect at all. Not to mention Anne Hathaway's response is the most inappropriate garbage I've ever seen. I know people who react stronger when the girl at Starbucks get's their order wrong! The rest of the dialogue consists of cliché after cliché, and I got bored after about 5 minutes after he starts his internship.

Personally it was nice to see DeNiro in his old age, acting as a sweet and lovable guy. It shows a real range in acting from his youth. A man who has been in the film industry this long deserves credit for carrying this thinly veiled attempt to make a quick buck from those of you looking for a movie to see on date night.

Sorry guys, but be prepared to snooze.

Turfseer,"De Niro-Hathaway chemistry warms the heart The Intern managed to garner only a 51 score on Metacritic. Why so? Written and directed by Nancy Meyers, whose ""It's Complicated"" I also admired, the film begins with a voice-over by one of the story's protagonists, Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro), a 70 year old widower whose life is empty due to the loss of his wife. At first he informs us being on his own for the first time in years was exciting, as he was able to travel around the world and experience new things. But once home, despite attempting to keep busy, he still feels alone. Participating in seemingly uplifting activities such as weekly tai chi classes provides little solace as it does nothing to provide the companionship and a purpose in life which he so craves.

Remarkably, the voice-over is revealed to be a video pitch, as Ben is applying to a Senior Citizen intern program at About the Fit, an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a thirtyish bundle of energy whose workaholic ways jeopardize her family life at home (consisting of a husband and very cute young daughter).

If Ben's finding of the notice for the senior citizen intern program is the inciting incident, the ""call to adventure"" occurs after Ben passes all the interviews at the firm and is hired to be one of four interns. It's no accident that Ben finds that Jules's new internet startup is in the same building as his old employer, a defunct phone book manufacturer. In many ways, Ben retains the ""talismans"" of his old world—his sage advice to many of the young male employees is always to keep a handkerchief in one's possession at all times, as it might come in handy to comfort a weeping female who might experience an emotional upset at an inopportune time.

Just as the young employees at the startup warm up to Ben, who is at heart a good guy, Jules at her core is also quite sweet. She has a ""save the cat"" moment (the moment in the first act of a screenplay when the protagonist performs a good deed, highlighting a good nature). This occurs when Jules promises a customer that she'll personally call the vendor who screwed up an order involving bridal gowns, have the gowns sent in time for the wedding and then refund the customer's money.

When Ben is assigned to be Jules' personal intern, this gives him an opportunity to play the part of mentor (or father figure) to Jules and become (as he puts it during the initial narration) ""whole again."" When he spies Jules' chauffeur drinking on the job, he orders him not to drive her, thus saving her from harm.

In an even more telling moment during the first half of the second act, Jules asks one of her aides to have Ben transferred because she fears he's ""too observant."" Jules fears intimacy and hides under the mask of the driven boss. After two days of finding herself warming up to Ben, she forgets about her earlier request to have him transferred and finds herself apologizing to Ben after her aide carries out her earlier (but no longer extant) wishes.

We might conclude that Jules too has experienced a loss and, like Ben, seeks to become ""whole."" Would it be too much of a stretch to conclude that Jules's intimacy problem stems from competition with her mother for the love of her father—and that she identifies with the father who might have been an over-achiever like her? Indeed, it's the comic machinations at the midpoint that highlight Jules's friction with her mother. Ben, along with some of Jules's employees, break into Jules's parents' home, in order to delete a rather nasty and embarrassing email inadvertently sent by Jules to her mother by accident.

The ""ordeal"" in the second half of the second act proves to be turbulent on the emotional level. Indeed, here it's Ben discovering that Jules's seemingly ""perfect"" husband is having an affair with a mother of one of the children their daughter is friendly with. Jules is also aware of the affair and Ben helps Jules cope with the crisis in a frank but reassuring talk while on a business trip to San Francisco.

On the ""road back,"" Jules must not only resolve the problem with her husband but decide whether to hire a CEO to replace her, which the investors of the company have been clamoring for. The marital discord is resolved when Jules's husband unexpectedly shows up at the office and has a heart to heart begging forgiveness (Jules is more than willing to forgive him). Again it's Ben's wise counsel that convinces Jules not to let the company be taken over by an outsider and potentially ruin everything she's achieved.

De Niro gives a remarkably sensitive performance as the man who steps in as a father figure at precisely the right time in order to assist the beleaguered Jules. He not only finds ""wholeness"" helping Jules and her employees but finds love with the startup's in-house masseuse (Rene Russo). There is a telling shot towards the beginning of The Intern, where Ben is waiting for hours to see Jules and it's rather sad how he's all alone, and his adventure really hasn't begun. But after Jules has resolved her situation, Ben realizes that his time at the firm is up and he's accomplished all that he wanted to do. Now he pursues his tai chi class with vigor, having achieved the spiritual integration he was seeking.

It should also be noted that the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and De Niro is palpable. There is something very warm about Hathaway's acting and her journey toward wholeness is cathartic. The Intern might have some moments of silliness, but it still touches the heart.", 1/10,"2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

stevenrosendale,"Bad The question you have to ask is why does this film get a 7 / 10 on IMDb but a 5 / 10 everywhere else? This is the worst film i have ever seen. Instead of watching this film you could just as easily place a gun in your mouth and when you feel the cold steel hit the back of your throat...pull the trigger. If you find yourself on the floor and still lucid then take another shot near your temple and finish the job. It says that my review is not long enough so I will also add that I really hope Robert Deniro got paid a hell of a lot of money to demean himself in this way. At least films such as Meet the Fockers where he takes a side step from his serious acting was hilariously funny and had something to offer. This film on the other hand is aimed at an audience of 16 yr old buskers, coffee connoisseurs and activists.

athena-j-dennis,"Like watching a train wreck occur over an hour and a half What do you get when you combine all of the memes and clichés of our shallow, tech-obsessed post-globalisation, hipster world and then have a wise, humble, dapper and old fashioned gent (Robert De Niro) as the ever congenial retiree intern.

What's baffling is De Niro's character. He has a complete lack of anysort of antipathy or disillusionment for finding himself in that situation - being bossed around the office and managed by people who have been on this planet for a quarter of the time he has, and who are genuinely childish, stupid and unprofesional.

In the real world - this sort of business which is completely devoid of any depth or intelligence would be hard to find. Although the bad acting make this bag full of design agency clichés all the more hard to swallow. This film is like a strange alternate universe and it is indeed like watching an atomic blast slowly unfold.

Switched off twenty minutes in when I realised that these people were not behaving this way ironically, they were actually seriously attempting to portray a workplace of today.

Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life.", 7/10,"22 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

neil-476,"Likable light drama Following the death of his wife, 70-year old Ben feels a need to recover some purpose in his life, so he joins an up-and-coming internet fashion company under their mature intern program, and finds himself assigned to founder and CEO Jules Ostin. The company has grown to the extent that Jules is overworked and overstressed, and spends insufficient time with her young daughter and husband. She is initially disinclined to use Ben's skills, but he gradually begins to prove his value to her.

I'm beginning to get used to Hollywood creating misleading trailers. The trailer for this movie sells it strongly as a comedy, and it really isn't (apart from one slapstick burglary episode, which feels as if it belongs in a different movie). Instead, what we have is a gentle – and rather unsurprising – drama, with some amusing moments, and likable performances from all concerned, with DeNiro unusually playing a character who is really rather ordinary (apart from a touch of OCD which, together with several other plot threads – Jules' mother, an office romance – goes unexplored).

DeNiro and Hathaway develop a pleasing chemistry and, if the main problems thrown up in the story get resolved a little too glibly, well, we do like a happy ending, don't we?", 8/10,"3 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

maurice_yacowar,"Senior citizen provides salutary model in modern office and lives In The Intern Nancy Meyers engagingly blends the old and new in terms of cinema, technology and feminism.

Hero Ben is a feminist from the outset because his late wife Molly was a middle school principal, i.e., a woman who combined success in family and in administration. So Ben appreciates the old feminism as well as the new that he sees in Jules (a man's name feminized by its homonym Jewels). As Jules notes, ""It's 2015, are we really still critical of working moms?"" Well, yeah, so Ben has to teach the other playground Moms the pride they should take in Jules's success. In business Ben unpacks his glass case, clock, calculator, pens, all superannuated — before launching into the computer world. He makes friends in the flesh as well as on Facebook. However new he may be to new tech, his old savvy in business, style and human relations proves a boon to the others. One young guy buys a classic briefcase on eBay.

Robert De Niro is an affable Old Man in the New Age spirit. He actually weeps a bit, sentimental mush that he admits to being. The established old geezer occupies the same role in the casting as his character does in the plot — he's the man of experience and wisdom who provides a model for the young bloods.

De Niro could be on the list of old actors that Jules cites as the lost generation of Men: Harrison Ford, Jack Nicholson. The film clip of Gene Kelly evokes an even earlier generation of softer, romantic men, suggesting the cycle of changing styles in film manhood. De Niro even plays against his own persona, when he serves as Jules's driver and when, before his interview, he rehearses his looks in the mirror. Shades of ""You talking' to me?"" The heist scene is described as an Ocean's 11 play but it also hearkens back to De Niro's Scorsese gangster period.

As Jules, Anne Hathaway exercises her own reputation as a difficult person to work with. Her boss character here is a promotion from the harried gofer she played in The Devil Wears Prada. She's warmer and more effective than the earlier Meryl Streep character.

Jules's drunken bar speech is central: as girls have grown into women on the American social landscape men have reverted to boys. Her husband is as sloppy, effete and juvenile as Ben's workmates. The husband had a brilliant career ahead of him, prioritized Jules's to become a stay-at-home father, then slips into the tired old cliché of adulterer.

The film is sensible in playing a 70-year-old as a sane, capable person, even still capable of having a sex life. Ben's affair with Fiona is played with taste and discretion. Some might add ""hope."" The film's one weak spot is its treatment of the shorter, homelier, much more wrinkled woman who pursues Ben and gives him the finger when she sees him with Fiona. Both in script and direction Meyers shows such sensitivity and grace in this film that it's disappointing to see her lapse here into the cliché comedy of the predatory crone. Rene Russo gives Fiona a dignity and attractiveness that might have also been accorded the other woman. Instead Meyers went for the cheap laugh — in an otherwise more serious work.", 6/10,"3 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

The screenplay of the film is superb and makes you smile, happy, rejuvenated and might make you cry as well. Acting as mentioned earlier is superb by the lead stars and is beautifully supported by the support cast. The end of the film could've been little more refined.

Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are good, though a lot of their meaningful scenes feel forced due to the writing and dialogue. I would've let it slide if 'The Intern' wasn't on for two hours - that's too much cheese for me.

All her employees love and adore her, although she NEVER acknowledged their existence nor knew their names. All of that ""candy land"" was a little bit too much for me. For me even the amazing actors didn't save this movie.

theshiptons,"Massive yawn fest the 2 stars are for De Niro, he is an actor of such high caliber that is wasted in this wishy washy flick. The premise is a good one and something that could have been taken to more places than this film did. Anne Hathaway is OK in her role but given the material she has to work with she struggles to show any brilliance. Mr De Niro is also hamstrung in his role as he seems to not be able to develop fully as a character. the drama what there is of it leaves you not really caring what happens to the people in this film. it is watchable, sadly predictable and too light and airy for my liking. Also I think the lack of a protagonist in this film is its hugest flaw. there is little serious conflict and not a lot of comedy.

meeza,"Not the best intern! I am internally grateful that you are taking a few minutes out of your day to read my cheesy review of Writer-Director Nancy Meyers' comedy ""The Intern"". I hope you make it through this puntership with flying colors. Anyways, the movie stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker. Ben is a 70 year old widower who is living out retired days, but needs to fill a void. He comes across an opportunity to be an intern in a senior citizens' internship program for a start-up fashion online company. Anne Hathaway co-stars as Jules, the Founder of the company who at first is reluctant to work with an older crowd, but then takes a genuine liking to Ben as not only a dependable intern, but a father figure. Of course, there are conflicts that are incorporated into the film that causes their relationship some challenges, and Jules' own relationship with her husband. I admired how Meyers directed the first hour of the movie, but then it looked like ""The Intern"" ran out of steam during the second half with too many elongated scenes; and that is why I could not give ""The Intern"" a review promotion. I did like De Niro as Ben, and Hathaway as Jules was not too shabby either. ""The Intern"" was 2 hours long, it didn't have to be. This intern could have done it's job in a sheer 90 minutes, but it stayed for not-needed overtime; and for that I can't highly recommend for you to hire ""The Intern"" into your movie watch company. *** Average", 2/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Therru_Babayaga,"No charm, no wits, no drama, nothing This is one of my most boring and horrible experiences in cinema.

At first I thought it was just going to be a little generic and predictable, but mostly harmless. A sub-par version of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""The Devil wears Prada"".

Then, it entered the second part, and everything went to hell. Seriously, the last hour of this film felt like 4 or 5, easily, with stupid situations going absolutely nowhere, horrendous dialogues, no character development, no change at all in any of them, and lots of cryngy moments.

To summarize it, this film had so many sub-plot going on all at once that it couldn't decide what type of film it was. It was not a comedy, it was not a drama, it was not a romance, it had no meaning, no pay- off, nothing to say about old people working and their impact on their life and the effect on the younger generations, except for a few jokes at the beginning. De Niro character was way too happy to need to work there in the first place, and was this ""angelic"" character that everyone loves, and Hathaway was at most a stressed-out woman, nowhere near as a bad person or someone rude to her employees. In the end, the characters almost didn't change at all. At most, Anne Hathaway got to relax a bit, but that's pretty much it. There were no character arcs for any of them, and no one learns anything or changes in any way. The husband/boyfriend (don't remember if they were married or not...) is a terrible person at the beginning and was just exactly the same at the end, the little girl ""struggle"" to not see enough of her mom went absolutely nowhere, neither how the younger interns dealt with their lives...

This movie was horrible, with its stupid music underlining every little moment, with its horrible pacing that made the last hour feel like at least four, with its horrible message about relationship, with all his terrible cliché on old people and working women, and people in the larger sense.

There was no heartwarming moments at all, no character felt vulnerable in any way, or relatable at all. The dialogues were tremendously bad, going absolutely nowhere, bringing us nothing, no wit or enjoyment or comedy. Which is very bad for a film resting entirely on people talking.

One of the worst piece of trash I've seen in my life.

PS: I love Anne Hathaway and respect De Niro, and I enjoyed ""The Holyday"" from this director, so it has nothing to do with any prior prejudice against anyone in this film. If anything else, Hathaway and De Niro are the ones that made me going to this movie. Thank you, guys, really. Still like you though, actors still got to eat.

Anurag-Shetty,"A simple & heartwarming tale that people of any age can relate to. The Intern tells the story of a widower named, Ben Whittaker(Robert De Niro). Apart from being a widower, Ben is also retired. One day, while going about his mundane everyday routine, he comes across a flyer. This flyer says, an up and coming online fashion website is doing a senior internship program & is looking for senior interns with years of work experience. The fashion website is founded & run by, Jules Ostin(Anne Hathaway). Ben seizes this golden opportunity to get back in the game. Ben spreads a positive attitude among his colleagues & his positive outlook, also rubs off on the usually uptight Jules.

The Intern is an outstanding film. The simplicity of the movie is what makes it so perfect. The film perfectly balances the comedic moments & the dramatic moments, & is a flawless fusion of comedy & drama. The break-in set piece is definitely one of the highlights of the movie. When the movie is funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny. However, there are several moments where the movie tugs at your heartstrings. The story of the movie might be simple however, director Nancy Meyers has done such a good job with the film that, it's this very simplicity that makes it flawless. The performances are another highlight of the film. Robert De Niro is outstanding as Ben. De Niro has starred in famous comedy films like the Meet the Parents trilogy however, his character in this film is extremely charming & likable. Very different from his role as the suspicious father-in-law in those movies. Anne Hathaway is outstanding as Jules. Hathaway gives a power packed performance & portrays all the ups & downs her character goes through, effortlessly. Rene Russo is brilliant as Fiona. Anders Holm is great as Matt. JoJo Kushner is adorable as Paige. Andrew Rannells is good as Cameron. Adam DeVine is awesome as Jason. Zack Pearlman is hilarious as Davis. Jason Orley is impressive as Lewis. Christina Scherer is amazing as Becky. Linda Lavin & Celia Weston are hysterical in their small roles as Patty & Doris. The Intern is a must watch for everyone who enjoys feel-good movies.", 1/10,"2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Sickly sweet and unrealistic behavior of the main characters, far removed from reality. Why can't they make good movies anymore?! I suffered through 2 hours of it. I guess I was hoping for a miracle, for a twist that would elevate it above the level of a filler. But no, to the very end it kept the quality of adolescent slush with no depth or sophistication. I guess I can't expect more from an Anne Hathaway movie. What a waste of time! I recommend that you give this one a miss.

deepfrieddodo,"Fun Workplace Story Turning from fun to heartfelt, The Intern does a lot of things right in this drama-comedy. De Niro plays the endearing lead as the retired widower returning to work far below his expertise, to assist the workaholic Hathaway who is yet to discover a hands-off approach. One character quite fresh, the other fairly well known.

An array of characters each with their own small dilemmas to overcome are fed in to the wider plot, creating more of a holistic workplace story, whilst never delving into anything serious like the leads.

Parts can be predictable, others entirely shoe-horned in to provide a closing scene on unimportant tertiary characters, but that doesn't stop the plot from being fun and at times heartwarming.

phd_travel,"Delightful and well written, moving and funny Good job Nancy Meyers for creating another enjoyable delightful (not silly), grown up comedy with likable characters. A Brooklyn startup hires a senior intern. This movie has a lot more going for it than just generational and age difference jokes as seen on the trailer. The plot is equally about a modern career woman running a start up and her juggling her kid and stay at home husband - a real modern family. This is equally Robert De Niro's movie and Anne Hathaway's movie. He is relatable and likable and wise and she is stylish and shows the many sides of her character. Brooklyn is attractively shown with pretty brownstones inside and out and parks. This is one of those comedies that can be watched again because it's so pleasing original well written beautifully filmed and well acted. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments and many chuckles throughout plus some moving moments.

rannynm,"A ""Must-Watch"" Comedy that Beats All Expectations! Add The Intern to your list of ""must-watch"" movies because this delightful comedy beats all expectations. The film is about charming, 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, and his quest to join the work force after already being retired. Upon receiving the position of a senior intern at an online fashion website, he finds himself bonding with all the other young co- workers and is immediately loved by everyone. Ben is then assigned to intern for the owner of the company, Jules Ostin, and their opposite personalities create a bond between them that helps them through their lives.

The film's outstanding choice of actors really impacts the quality of the movie because if Robert De Niro didn't play Ben, I wouldn't have been as attached to his character. The character development is the biggest aspect of the movie and, since they use great actors, they successfully win the hearts of the audience and build a bond with the viewer instantly.

I am really impressed with the comedy because I feel as though comedies these days are too desperate to be funny and it's really obvious. They often throw in as many famous people as they can and have an under-developed plot to make the movie feel like a joke that should not be taken seriously. The Intern, however, is hilarious while remaining sophisticated. It is surprisingly funny and I caught myself cracking up all the time. The plot is very well developed and includes plot twists and a climax that I honestly would not expect.

The ending is fulfilling which saved me from my fear of being left hanging or disappointed since the whole movie leading up to it is amazing. The film is enjoyable for people of all interests, ages and genders because it's an all around feel-good movie that you don't need to be in a certain mood to watch.

The dialogue is insanely natural and realistic which makes it hard for me to believe that the lines are from a script. The little details like facial expressions or even a comment said under a character's breath really made the movie authentic. I also enjoyed the amazing storyline and moral messages.

I will definitely watch this film again and encourage my friends and family to watch it as well because it is worth seeing. This film is best suited for ages of 13 to 18 as well as adult and I give it 4 ½ out of 5 stars.

namashi_1,"A Delight! Nancy Meyers's 'The Intern' is A Delight! Its sweet, uncomplicated & thoroughly charming. And The Leads, are simply brilliant!

'The Intern' Synopsis: 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin.

I haven't enjoyed a film off late as much as I did while watching 'The Intern'. This is a clean entertainer, that can be watched with your entire family, despite a few adult references. Its a beautiful story about aging, love & life. The unlikely friendship between its Protagonists, is a shining example of why this comedy works so wonderfully.

No one does lighthearted films better than Meyers & 'The Intern' finds her at her finest. Her Screenplay, though not perfect, is still well-penned & also heartfelt. Meyers's Direction is perfect, handling all the emotions on-screen, with flourish. Stephen Goldblatt's Cinematography is bright. Robert Leighton's Editing is pretty good. Art & Costume Design are satisfactory.

Performance-Wise: Bob De Niro & Anne Hathaway are the life & soul of 'The Intern'. De Niro is effortlessly charming, delivering a richly layered performance. Hathaway, on the other-hand, is simply remarkable, adding tremendous depth to her part. And the on-screen chemistry between the two Oscar-Winners, is the highpoint of the enterprise. Supporting them wholeheartedly, is the Wonderful Rene Russo, who's lovable here & Adam DeVine who shines as one of De Niro's colleagues.

On the whole, 'The Intern' is must watch. Easily, The Sweetest Film of the year so far!", 5/10,"3 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

davispittman,"Nancy Meyers does it once again! Nancy Meyers's newest film, The Intern, starring Anne Hathaway, Robert De Niro, and Rene Russo is very entertaining and well made. The chemistry between all the actors was impeccable! This movie has some of the best chemistry between characters I've seen in a while. Robert and Anne were absolutely delightful here! All the performances by all the actors were very good, light hearted, funny at times, emotional and just makes you happy to watch. The script and dialogue was pretty good, very heart warming and enjoyable. The Intern is just a good old fashioned feel good heart warming fun movie that I think anyone could and would enjoy! Not that I expected it to be bad at all, I mean come on, it's Nancy freaking Meyers! Go watch all the Nancy Meyers movies, every one of them! 7/10.

jaysanchu07,"Absurd. Corporate Life Isn't This Perfect My Friends. Credit can be given to this film for its truly funny bits, but The Intern is ultimately bogged down by two inconveniences: a seriously crappy storyline & amateur screenplay.

The setting pushed by the film borders the impossible, as Robert De Niro's character seems to receive all conveniences handed to him, in a silver platter. It is also quite bothersome, that the character can do no wrong, receiving applause for the most shallow of reasons. It is then a sorry attempt to force the likability of a lead through absurd outcomes, that expectedly backfired.

As for the screenplay, talk about amateur hour. Not only is the actual script unimpressive, the dialogue felt absolutely staged. Conversations were stiff & ""acting"" was all too obvious.

In summary, this not a good film plain & simple. Performances by both RDN & Anne Hathaway were passable, but the way this film was crafted, felt B movie-ish. 5/10.", 10/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

This was beyond a doubt an absolutely splendid feel good. But yet at the same time, it was more than that. It showed the (albeit glorified) but true potential that an experienced worker can bring to a workplace. Truly a marvel.

Deniro's character always makes you smile and makes you feel happy like he does to other characters in the movie.

The only problem in the movie is the second half which in my opinion is a little bit direct and focusing on only one point.

I just does not like the ending.. the other than day.. it was perfect although I watch it in the cinema when it was release and rewatched it a couple of times.. before I found out that I never really got the chance to rate it.. so I decided to rewatched one more time in order to rate it.

The movie was flawless, feel good time, inspiring and motivational for start up, youngster and old a like

The chemistry bond between Ben and Jules were uncanny

Everyone played their part so well with the script and direction too

Why I did not gave the movie 10 stars is because of the ending which I prefer Jules to have hired the CEO on the point of view to ease up her work load and to expand her business.

srdjan_veljkovic,"It's a pity such a good premise dissolved into a kind of oblivion It starts OK. Goes into an interesting situation pretty much unassuming. There are a few good jokes. You see glimpses of DeNiro ""from the good old days"".

But, slowly yet steadily, it dissolves into a half-hearted feminist propaganda. DeNiro clearly doesn't buy the ""I shouldn't be the feminist here"", even though he does deliver it like a pro.

It could have actually been better if the feminist agenda got carried through all the way. One would like it or not, but, it would be that kind of a movie (an ""agenda movie""). Like this, ""half-way through"", it just doesn't feel it's going anywhere.

Of course, the best thing would have been just to continue and finish like they started, without any agenda, just telling a story about an interesting situation. Could have been really good. DeNiro and Hathaway do play good together. Writing showed obvious talent. It's a pity.", 2/10,"2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I was surprised to find a movie that was 100% positive, with no mean people or bad things happening. I was even more surprised that it wasn't corny or boring. It was entertaining and gave me only positive emotions (and believe me, I get annoyed very easily). I didn't even mind the slightly feminist tone it took. Probably the great actors had something to do with it. It is not a cinematic masterpiece. The story isn't very challenging or specially clever. But it still was a great movie.

anaconda-40658,"Screenplay Needed an Intern. The Intern (2015): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Adam DeVine: Absolutely boring comedy about relating to those least likely. Robert De Niro plays Ben Whitaker, a senior who answers an ad that is open to senior interns at a fashion company. Anne Hathaway plays JulesOstin, CEO of the company who reluctantly gets paired with Ben. This turns out to be a plus for her when he ends up being a positive force both in and out of work. She begins to rely on him and this is where Nancy Meyers goes wrong. The humour is either too subtle or completely over the top. Three embarrassing scenes stand out. One involves an overworked grieving secretary whose whimper should have called for either recasting or several more takes until she got it right. Next we have Adam DeVine, who was so good in the Pitch Perfect films, get shafted into a dreadful scene where he plays watch-out while listening to head phones. Anders Holm as Ostin's cheating husband gives a hideous plead for forgiveness that is laughable and unconvincing. De Niro does his best playing someone who can work under pressure while boosting those around him up. Hathaway is unfortunately subdued in bad writing that is beneath her. Rene Russo shows up briefly to give De Niro a massage, which prompts cheers from the office. Theme regards not being too old to be useful, but also being able to assist future generations reach higher potential. Unfortunately for Meyers that potential is not met here. Instead we have a comedy devoid of laughs and works better than a sleeping pill. Score: 2 ½ / 10", 4/10,"5 out of 16 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

""The Intern"" (2015) is probably one of the cheesiest movies you will in many moons. It is so sugar sweet, that sometimes i wanted to roll my eyes. But it's not that it is not a good movie. It is a good movie, solidly acted by all involved, script is involving. Directing was very solid, at running time almost 2 hours this movie never drags. It is of course predictable as hell, but i liked the overall experience. You can watch this movie with a while family - this is more like a super sweet good feel family movie rather then a comedy, and there is some super sweet good humor.

Overall, ""The Intern"" is not a straightforward comedy as you might thing from seeing the poster or reading synopsis. It is a very sweet and sometimes funny movie. It's the one where EVERYTHING is super cute and sometimes shamelessly sweet, but it is a very good movie for a quite Sunday evening.", 8/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

calspers,"Did De Niro intern ""The Intern""? ""The Intern"" (2015) written and directed by Nancy Meyers I thought was a much weaker film than some of her excellent earlier work such as ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""It's Complicated"".

First off, I thought Meyers had problems settings the stage for the premise of the film, particularly in terms of the company run by Jules (Anne Hathaway). More than that, I was not enamored by her performance.

I think Ben (Robert De Niro) was a slightly strange casting call to play the retired cute guy. Because he is De Niro he still nailed it, but I just prefer him as his usual alpha bad-ass character. He might actually have been interning for this part originally intended for Morgan Freeman. Furthermore, his relationship with Fiona got off a little strange but cute as well.

Still, the film had moderate entertainment value, although it was very predictable. All in all, I thought it was a relatively weak achievement by Meyers, especially compared with her earlier excellent work.", 4/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

vincentlynch-moonoi,"Top notch with fine performances by DeNiro and Hathaway I hadn't heard much about this film, but I like Robert DeNiro (in his non-gangster roles) and I like Ann Hathaway. And, I hadn't been to a movie in a while, so I thought -- what the heck. I was surprised on a Wednesday afternoon how big the audience was, admittedly mostly seniors (including me).

You know how every once in a while a film just all fits together perfectly? Well, this is one of those films. Absolutely delightful, perfect casting, with just a little tension because you're not sure where things are going. Will the senior intern become ill (almost seems so for a while). Will he become the CEO being sought? Will she retire? If Robert De Niro is in a film that is not gangster related (in a broad sense), I'll be there (especially as he has matured). And here, as the senior intern, he is something special. Anne Hathaway, as the company founder, impressed me here, particularly when she cried. Notice that her crying seems real...she gets all red in the face and just looks terrible. She had a nice mix of vulnerable and in-charge scenes. Rene Russo was interesting as the massage specialist (and love interest for DeNiro). Anders Holm was quite good as Hathaway's husband, although he had probably the worst looking beard I've ever seen in a film. Nice to see Andrew Rannells as an executive at the company. Adam DeVine was quite entertaining as an associate with little luck with women. Zack Pearlman, as another intern, was off-beat but entertaining. Interesting to see Linda Lavin as an older woman out to snare DeNiro.

The story is quite simple. Hathaway founded a woman's clothing company, and runs it all herself, while still having a family where a ""house husband"" plays the at-home role. But, he's having an affair, in large part because she has no time for him. Andrew Rannells wants to institute a senior intern program, and DeNiro becomes the intern for Hathaway. At first she doesn't like him, or the concept, and asks to have him transferred...although quickly realizes he has helped her center her life a bit. They become very close, with the big question being how can her marriage survive, and will DeNiro guide her to a good solution.

It's difficult for me to think of something to criticize. It seems all pretty perfect. I guess I could for more characters who shave. But aside from that I wouldn't want to change anything. Incidentally, the daughter, JoJo Kushner, is terrific.

Just sit back and savor a very fine movie.", 9/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

kylenewalker,"Cute Doesn't Cut It Overall, and a lot of people have said this, The Intern is cute. But cute doesn't cut it. The plot is silly--a seniors intern program at an online clothing upstart. The characters are flat but not without their charm. And the writing is scattered. While The Intern does have some touching moments and a few cute jokes about the novelty of the situation, it comes incredibly short as it feels like a bunch of ideas are being pulled together and held in place by DeNiro and Hathaway. Take a little Lost in Translation (complete with a platonic hotel bathrobe scene), throw in a little Baby Boom (an earlier Myers script) with a career woman trying to have it all, and finish it with over-the-top hipster caricatures.

And the subplot of Jules (Hathaway) trying to find balance at home...by the looks of it, her husband didn't HAVE TO be a stay-at-home dad. He could've kept his job and they could have lived quite comfortably with child care arrangements. But then you wouldn't have a subplot.

Wait for this one to come out on Netflix. Baby Boom is a lot cuter anyway.", 8/10,"17 out of 33 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

JankiSharma,"never too old to learn new ways I like Nancy Meyers directing style ( the Holiday, Something's Gotta Give).The cast of the Intern is a good ensemble of Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway and Rene Russo. the movie has class, simple funny lines and an easy and natural flow of words. Anne Hathaway as Jules and Robert De Niro as Ben have excellent conversations. I liked the way the scenes after Ben sees Jules husband Matt with another woman are handled. Ben's discomfort and conflicts between his true feelings and reality checks are beautiful.

Rene Russo is a healthy distraction in the movie. Among all the unfamiliar faces for me in the movie, I particularly liked Andrew Rannelis as Cameron. He was excellent as Jules friend and manager.Some scenes involving Jason (Adam DeVine) needed editing. Nice to see Ben see things Jules way. good screenplay. Good movie. Good for the young and the old. See things differently. We learned that from former First Lady Hilary Clinton.

subxerogravity,"Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have beautiful chemistry together. The intern turned out to be a great movie to sit though. I herd I was not going to like it, but that was so not true.

No matter what the movie is about it all comes down to the relationship between Ben Whitaker a 70 year old widower looking to keep active in order to prevent death,and Jules Ostin, a young woman who runs a successful company that Ben comes to intern for.

I seemed out of touch with some of the characters being portrayed in the film, but the performances of such fine actors under the direction of Nancy Meyers makes a timeless piece about what two people can give to each other.

I would have never though of De Niro and Hathaway being paired in such a matter but they work so well on screen together. It's worth taking a look at.

palavitsinis,"Not so silly, worthwhile and touching Well, if you love Robert De Niro, if you love Anne Hathaway and if you happen to be in this line of work (startups, companies, etc.), then this movie will not be anything shorter that brilliant!

Performances are amazing, an excellent supporting cast and a 100% capture of the office reality and the different types of people within. 100% to the spot with all this hip generation and the new fad of startups, etc.

The plot, although a bit expected, manages to combine all the little things that are paramount to the everyday of any working person in time-consuming positions. The gentle intrusion of De Niro as a pensioner that brings his own demeanor and outlook on things is invaluable.

De Niro through his character shows to all of us, fast-paced, time- deprived and life-deprived generation X or Y or whatever, that there's always room for calmness and for living. It's a movie that is actually a lesson in disguise, that no one should miss.

It's a total opposite to Devil Wears Prada format... intern takes Anne Hathaway as the boss of a company she creates and it's ruining her private life as she's driven and committed, but she's not like Meryl Streep's character she starred in!

There are some hilarious moments! I'm not used to seeing DeNiro doing a film like this but he does it well!

He was always dressed at costume and his suitcase, old school stuff. Hes boss was played by Anne Hathaway an smart young lady which had a hard life and tried so hard to keep her business afloat + combining with her real life marriage... even if she wasnt crazy about the new intern and kind of ignored him, he really managed to find a spot in her heart and got close to her.

I would love to be 80 and have his vitality and will to live :D.

montgomerysue,"big misfire I have seen Hallmark movies that were way more entertaining than this. The first hour of the movie is sort of interesting and cute, but the remainder of the film is pretty mediocre, with the last half hour being talky, excruciatingly boring, and predictable. There are other problems here, too. There is absolutely no chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Anders Holm, who play a married couple. Maybe that's because Holm is such a lousy actor. And the movie is loaded with cliches. For example, Holm is a stay at home dad while his wife works. So, of course, he has to dress like a slob and have a ratty beard. Stuff like that abounds here. DeNiro gives a very controlled performance (is he bored, too?) and one wonders if, 40 years ago when he was heralded as America's greatest living actor, he would have even considered doing tripe like this. But, time and finances changes everything !

sanjeevanwar,"Great going even in 70's Anwar Says: Read somewhere that Deepika Padukone is going to produce remake of INTERN , with Late Rishi Kapur ,but after his death recently announced Mr. Bachchan in the lead . This prompted me to watch the original and I found it on Netflix.

Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway starrer, written and directed by Nancy Meyers and she has been able to squeeze every ounce of the star quality of the duo. A retiree joins a successful startup as senior intern and was assigned the job of aide of top boss , who moves on bicycle inside the office. She initially finds him extra observant and nosy but later appreciates him as a true friend, philosopher and guide.

The affability and helpfulness is the key of the character Ben and there is a lot of inter- generational exchange and Jules,the heavily burdened career oriented woman, at one point of time helps him to make Facebook account. Meyer's articulate direction has succeeded in making Ben winning the trust of Jules to the extent, she discusses her husband's extra- marital relationship and the Man Friday reunited them . The ten seconds self - description by De Niro and the masseur Rene Russo has been superbly conveyed.

I can't doubt the caliber of Mr. Bachchan but the natural delivery of Mr. Niro would be always comparable.

Waiting eagerly for the Indian Version, a next year release.

npvarley,"A terrific movie! I will admit that I ain't quite sure what to expect from this movie when I sat down to watch it. Boy, what I got was terrific movie, one of the best of 2015, IMO.

De Niro gives his best performance in years. He's often come across as a bit samey in recent years, like he's just playing the same guy over and over again, almost wooden. But in this movie, he manages to re-animate and plays his part superbly. He shows great skill in delivering his lines with just the right air of worldly-wise experience and charm.

Anne Hathaway has become one of my favourite actresses. She really turning in some great performances since she, IMO, broke out in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". She always seems so genuine and has a smile that lights up the screen. She struck just the right note of disarray, her work life blossoming and her family life withering away.

The supporting cast, particularly the other interns, were excellent. A special word for JoJo Kushner, who played Paige, Anna Hathaway's daughter. She's a complete natural. In fact, the chemistry amongst the cast really shone through.

rgkarim,"Gets the Job Done Robbie K back again with another movie review. This time I'll be focusing on the latest Comedy entitled the Intern starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. These two actors are legends for bringing roles to life, and from the trailers promise to bring their talents back to the silver screen for a heartwarming adventure. Does this movie live up to that promise? As always please read on to find out.

The story of the Intern is a simple tale about two lost people in need of something to help get their lives back on track. It's plot is very formulaic, lacking any twists or turns to offset the predictable path it follows. Both characters backgrounds are very typical of Nancy Meyers' work involving some unbalanced, dramatic family dynamic that is in need of some tuning up. Despite the familiar plot dynamic, The Intern somehow stands out from the mire of comedies that currently flood the market. For one, the movie is very relatable and realistic, with characters you latch on to within twenty minutes of the film's start. Ben (De Niro) and Jules (Hathaway) are characters who have morals and qualities fans of all ages will love, such as diligence, compassion, and rationality that many comedy/drama characters lack. And for once I wasn't annoyed by characters in a comedy/drama, but rather interested in seeing where their stories would go. In addition, the story kept taking different avenues, mixing up the drama to provide different obstacles for our characters to overcome (much like life), keeping things fresh. The major flaws with this story are small gaps that arise in the plot, things conveniently being settled at a drop of the hat, and some transitions that were a bit to random for me.

But while the story is not the most unique, or exciting for that matter, The Intern does provide a handful of life lessons wrapped in a heart string tugging package. Ben's morals are motivating, traditional values from a dying generation that are designed to motivate and inspire one to work hard and help others. Jules characteristics are meant to be empowering, breaking the traditional stay at home mom role and portraying women kicking modern day business in the can. While these morals may seem cheesy, and overdone, Meyers manages to deliver them in a very appropriate manner that bypasses the preachy, in your face lessons. Even the romantic dilemmas are professionally portrayed, bypassing the movie magic and instead giving a realistic approach as to how to handle problems. Perhaps the biggest, unrealistic component is the fact that everyone actually listened to them without much resistance, seeing as humans are so open for taking advice these days.

No matter how well a character is designed though, you need an actor to bring it to life, which this assembled cast more than accomplishes. De Niro continues his impressive track record, somehow playing epic characters, yet somehow playing himself. He brings that warm smile that brings confidence and wisdom, no matter the situation. Hathaway as well impressed me, as she wears the multiple hats of boss, friend, mother, and wife. She covers the emotional spectrum and manages to sell the pain and pressure that Jules suffers from. Separate these two are strong, but when acting together they are on an even higher level of quality. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, each well balanced into the grand story to play their parts and provide the laughs we so need.

Speaking of laughs, the Intern's comedy was a nice break from the overacted and ridiculously stupid stunts many comedies take these days. Instead it is witty, loaded with clever dialogue that is well timed and simplistic and for once not over done or drawn out in length. It branches across the age generations covering topics like love, balancing life with career, morals between old and new generations and bridging the technology gap. Each of these topics was tastefully done, relying on the actor's delivery to be funny instead of just some stupid catchphrase meant to be posted on memes.

The Intern is not the most unique movie to grace the theaters, and it feels very much like a typical Nancy Meyer's work. However, this movie throws at a lot of the movie magic and melodramatic drama for a film that is fun, positive, and a good bridge across generation gaps. The little family established in this picture will pull you into movie, and the two hours will fly by as you become engrossed in the characters' lives. For quality acting and a fun movie, The Intern is worth a trip to the theater, despite it's lacking of special effects. I encourage many to check it out when it comes out on Netflix or RedBox in the future.

My scores for the Intern are: Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0", 1/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

parameswaranrajendran,"Heart Warming The emotional heart melting drama starred by actor Robert De Niro (as 70 years old, Ben The senior intern) and actress Anne Hathaway (as Ben's boss, Jules). Do not expect me that will say this is a love story crap between two of them. This movie is far from that. It is about how an old intern, Ben changes the life of the hardworking & workaholic, Jules together with some emotional drama. I hate to say this but this movie made my eyes to tear for few scenes.

Elizabds,"1 star Two things struck me about this film as awful. First, for such a huge budget film, did they really have to play the same music over and over and over and over and over again? Wasn't there funding to find someone with a sense of artistry to select better music or at least a wider variety of sounds? Second, the writing was awful and the dialog was idiotic. Wasn't the least bit interested in either of the two lead characters. I would have left before it ended, but we paid full price and I am an optimist: I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. On the plus side, the sets and wardrobe were nice.

tord-1,"A delightful feel-good movie With main actors like Renee Russo and Robert de Niro of the older generation and Anne Hathaway of the younger, supported by a wealth of good actors like Anders Holm, Andrew Rannells, Adam Devine, Zack Perlman, and Christina Scherer (to mention a few) it is not surprising that this film is so good as it is!

Director/writer Nancy Meyers have again made a memorable movie!

What's it about?

Well, to quote the synopsis:

""A retired 70-year-old widower is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position.

The founder of the company is Jules Ostin, a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic.

Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing.""

But a lot of things do happen, sad, funny, and very realistic!

A great movie, by a great ensemble and a great director/writer.

Oh, I liked the cinematography, too.Steven Goldblatt was the man behind the camera — for once not a lot of shaky camera work, very rare today!", 6/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

kamleshsemail,"The Intern: A Delightful and Heartwarming Film That Hits All the Right Notes ""The Intern"" is an absolute gem of a movie that effortlessly combines entertainment, laughter, and a heartwarming story. From start to finish, this film kept me thoroughly engaged, leaving me with a smile on my face long after the credits rolled. Nancy Meyers masterfully crafts a delightful tale that beautifully captures the essence of human connection and the power of intergenerational relationships.

One of the standout aspects of the film is the exceptional performances by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. De Niro's portrayal of Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower taking on an internship, is nothing short of brilliant. He brings a charming blend of wisdom, humor, and vulnerability to the character, making Ben an endearing and relatable presence. Hathaway delivers a captivating performance as Jules Ostin, the young and driven CEO. Her portrayal perfectly balances the complexities of a woman navigating both personal and professional challenges, drawing viewers into her journey with authenticity and grace.

The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is undeniable. Their on-screen dynamic is a joy to watch, as they develop a genuine friendship that transcends generational boundaries. Their interactions are filled with witty banter, genuine moments of vulnerability, and mutual growth. It's a testament to the talent of both actors that they effortlessly bring these characters to life and make their connection feel authentic and heartfelt.

What sets ""The Intern"" apart is its ability to tackle important themes with a light touch. The film explores the value of experience, the need for work-life balance, and the struggles faced by women in positions of power. It does so with nuance and sensitivity, weaving these issues seamlessly into the narrative.

In addition to its strong performances and thought-provoking themes, ""The Intern"" boasts impeccable production design and a delightful soundtrack that complements the story perfectly. The film beautifully captures the vibrant energy of the workplace, juxtaposed with the quiet moments of introspection.

Ultimately, ""The Intern"" is a feel-good movie that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. It reminds us that age is just a number and that we can find purpose and fulfillment in unexpected places. It celebrates the power of friendship, the value of human connection, and the wisdom that comes with life experience. With its stellar performances, engaging storytelling, and uplifting message, ""The Intern"" is a must-watch for anyone seeking an entertaining and genuinely good-hearted film experience.", 9/10,"2 out of 2 found this helpful.

thekarmicnomad,"Doesn't practise what it preaches - and it preaches a lot Anne Hatherway has started her successful business from the ground up using a hand on management approach. She is forced to take a ""senior intern"" in the form of De Nero who she initially butts heads with, but soon they warm to one another.

This film has the potential to be warm and funny (it generally is) but is very preachy. There are clumsy dialogues regarding prejudice and inequality that come out of nowhere.

This film is even-handed if nothing else, if you are going to be beaten with the feminist stick then expect a battering with... whatever the opposite is.

The worse thing about this film though is that it challenges the idea (we all apparently have) that old people are stupid, useless liabilities. De Niro disproves this idea. Yet all the jokes are based around how all the other older characters are ridiculous and incapable.

By the end I felt like I had sat through one of those awful mandatory HR training films. I had been force fed a load of information I already knew with very little entertainment value.

All that said, production is good, acting is good and this isn't a terrible watch - I just expected more laughs and less sermon.", 6/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I especially love how every one of the younger characters naturally gravitates to Ben (De Niro), and without him trying to convince anyone of anything, they all naturally tyr to emulate him.

Prismark10,"Starting over The Intern is an easy going, genial film. Not laugh out funny and does not really has a lot to say apart from older people have skills and values that are worth something.

Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired and on his own and wants something to do. He gets a position as an intern at an online fashion start up that is doing very well.

Ben shadows the founder of the company Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) who is a workaholic and trying to balance work and family life. She is reluctant to have Ben around seeing his as being too old but Ben perseveres. Suddenly he is an asset to the other interns who find his life experience valuable and also to Jules who after her initial hesitation finds him someone she can rely on.

Writer/Director Nancy Meyers brings an assured touch for what is really an old fashioned story with a modern twist. De Niro is comfortable playing Gentle Ben, knocking about with the younger interns and he even gets romance sub plot. He has a spine of steel and there is the revelation that he is interning in a place where he used to work for many decades, an industry overtaken by IT.

Anne Hathaway's character reminded me of a little too much of The Devil wears Prada, she was certainly a little too abrasive at first even discriminatory towards old people.

However once the film settles down it is amiable but does feel over- long and rather cloying by the end.", 8/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

randymcbeast,"A pointless pile of fluffy feathers I suppose some Hollywood exec thought that by pairing one of the best actors of many generations with the always engaging and lovely Anne Hathaway would cover all the demographic bases and produce a solid moneymaker. Sadly, that wasn't the case and now this movie is stuck on both of their resumes as the sell-out movie that nobody cared about.

De Niro is my favorite male actor too, and Hathaway one of my top fav female actors. So, I did enjoy watching the two work together but couldn't they have found a better script? This one was plain rubbish and the whole movie was just disgustingly pleasant and pointless the whole way through. Everything in it's place and every day sunny. Barf! I can see why Hathaway took the movie though. Strong woman role and working with Bobbie D, no-brainer, but why would De Niro take it? Does he need the money? After such an illustrious career leading some of the greatest movies of all time, he decided it's time to play an Intern for an Internet startup company in a movie with no meaning whatsoever? It's truly a sad day for De Niro fans.", 5/10,"3 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

davidm-64016,"Utterly charming if a little slow in places This is a really nice movie, and I mean that in a positive way. I was reminded how completely charming Anne Hathaway is, even if the premise had echoes of The Devil Wears Pravda. DeNiro is quiet and understated, so much so that you wonder if a Goodfellas moment is around the corner, but thankfully it's not. There could have been more about the other senior interns for something inside from comic relief, but otherwise a very watchable movie.

Anne Hathaway is adorable in it, did I mention that?

johntheholder,"Boring and greatly indifferent film Not much to say about this Nancy Meyers new film. Typical-boring HD photography and not much of a story going on.

Deniro plays a decent schmuck who got a job as a 70year old intern for a fashion company. There is no substance.

Anne Hathaway is supposed to be a very austere and multitasking Boss , yet a good and warm mother and person. OK , but in this film it isn't played out right, we don't care one bit.

Mainly its the script thats at fault.

It isn't a film that should have a spot on the map.

7.3 rating ? What?

Make that a 6.0 at best.

It's a film you look at while waiting at a dentist's office.

I am into comedies and dramedies a lot , just not into bad films.

Don't even watch this film , choose wiser.", 7/10,"7 out of 16 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

mireyamar,"Sometimes reality check does not work, still an entertaining movie After watching the first third of this movie, I prepared to write a quite negative review about it. I wanted to say that obviously, noone from the writers crew has ever worked in a company: appointments are never sent per usual email; there is NO paper in an office of an e-commerce company; CEO of a company would never cry in a meeting, no matter if a woman or a man; chauffeur and personal secretary for a boss of a company with only few hundred staff members, seriously? I can hardly imagine a guy as smart as Ben, being team lead for years and not able to switch on a computer; and last but not least, there are never so personal discussions in a working place, constantly addressing the feelings of everyone.

However, after watching more of this film, its charm got more and more to me. The chemistry between the main characters is great, it is well acted and the story became even more moving.

Still the ending bothered me somehow - does someone find it truly realistic that Jules' husband suddenly realizes how wrong his behaviour was and all his feelings leading to this behaviour disappear? And that Jule will feel good from now on coming home late and knowing her husband is spending a lot of time with the ladies where he found his affair previously?

Nevertheless, still this movie is fun to watch (it has some really good jokes), entertaining and made with love. I also found its message about empowering women very appealing and topical. I would recommend it, if you don't want to take it too seriously.", 6/10,"5 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

akcenat,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie but it lacks strong emotions Movie is following the story of a senior (Robert De Niro) who applies to work as an intern in an internet startup company which is run by Jules (Anne Hathaway).

""The Intern"" is something of a generational back- flip on ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Basically a generation gap drama-comedy with so many half-formed characters and a sense that it runs too long. This film proves how political correctness can damage a movie - everyone is so psychotically pleasant, not to mention Jules stay-at-home husband and an adorable daughter in addition to a stimulating career. Also, I haven't seen Robert De Niro play such a likable character in a very long time which here feels like he is lifeless. All of this makes ""The Intern"" a bland movie.

""The Intern"" has it's finger on the pulse of young and old, but the heartbeat is the thing it fails to detect. It's not an unpleasant way to spend some time, but movie is so forgettable because its desperately trying to be sweet, but actually is corny.

I wish that I could work here. It's relaxed it's fun, the boss is totally cool, it's modern and open minded. Really seems like perfect place to work.

I've always liked Anne Hathaway no matter what others say so I really think they chose the perfect person for this role.

What a totally relaxing and unusual movie for this time period. Everything needed like the old classic.

I will be watching again.

MplusA92,"This is recommended for ""Anne Hathaway"" lovers. What a lovely movie to spend your afternoon watching it ! It has the perfect mixture of comedy ""not for laughing out loud though"", sensations, good writing, ""Anne Hathaway"" different face expressions, ""Robert De Niro"" warm acting, and of course a good dose of drama especially in the last thirty minutes of the movie.

The movie follows multiple line of actions, one of ""Robert De Niro"" that shows us a good background about his character, and another one about ""Anne Hathaway"" that shows up her multiple layers continuously throughout the movie, and of course both of them meet up together to start the plot of the movie.

Finally, it's a light comedy drama movie with a genuine idea that was well represented with that group of actors, and of course it can get you out of a bad mood.

Needless to say, acting and expressions of Robert De Niro & Anne Hathaway was too good. Need to thank the director for giving us the glimpse into how online fashion startups work, so learnt a business lesson there. Overall, it's a perfect Saturday night movie! Only thing they could have improved is, movie was rather predictable, so audience could easily guess, what's coming up!

So Ben takes a job has an intern for a fashion company. And everybody seems to love him there, but will his uptight boss named Jules(Anne Hathaway) ever grow to like him?

This movie surprised me in many ways, De Niro and Hathaway have quite a great pairing. The film plays against so many movie clichés, just when you think it's gonna go one way, then it really surprises you. All the other cast are pretty good also. If you want a movie that so light on it's feet, then The Intern is that movie for you. And Anne Hathaway gives quite a good performance that is Oscar worthy. It's also nice to see De Niro be very light also.

gradyharp,"'The truth is... something about you makes me feel calm, or more centered, or something.' Now and then a movie comes along that instead of polarizing senior citizens against the younger Internet media obsessed generation elects to show how mutually beneficial the two ends of the age spectrum can be. And that is what Nancy Meyers (The Intern, It's Complicated, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, The Parent Trap, Father of the Bride, etc) has accomplished with aplomb in writing and directing this very fine little comedy with strong philosophical overtones. The fact that she is working with a cast of impeccable actors adds to the pleasure and meaning of this very fine little film. But in the long run it is the mutual respect for the two ends of the age divide that makes this a true 'comedy' rather that a mocking spoof.

70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker Robert De Niro) has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) – a true barnstormer of a creative personality obsessed with her success of her start up business. Jules is married to a stay at home dad (Anders Holm) and has a spunky child, but her work seems to take precedence – until the concept of a senior intern is forced upon her. Gradually the two come together in the most respectful and endearing way and form a heartfelt partnership that both need.

The supporting cast - Rene Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, Zach Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, Celia Weston et al – is to the person terrific. Played with a fine pacing and more information about Internet marketing than any book can offer, this is not only entertaining but a learning experience. Hathaway and De Niro are magic together.", 9/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

A story about an unusual intern/assistant that is not expected to do a good job but then turns out to be helpful and wanted?? Really?? Because nobody watched The Devil Wears Prada.

It does embrace some other topics (in an effort to make it seem less of a copy) such as the 'working mom', 'stay home dad', 'oldie-but-goodie' - but in such a trivial way. It adds nothing to the matters.

Anne's character is too apologetic, some characters seem to be calling the shots but then they just disappear. It's not an absolute waste of time because there are some (very little) funny moments. But even that shouldn't be a reason to watch it.

kingbk-2,"Long, Pedestrian Cheese Nancy Meyers is one of the most successful female writers/directors/producers in Hollywood. That's great because they have a major shortage of them. However, Nancy Meyers is also one of the most pedestrian writers/producers/directors in Hollywood. Her films always follow the same trajectory and have the same ""insert cliché here"" templates. They are very predictable and hardly challenging. ""The Intern"" is proof of this, a film that has many good messages, but is written with so much cheese and fluff that it would have fit better on The Hallmark Channel than as a major studio picture.

The movie stars Anne Hathaway as Jules Ostin, the CEO/Founder of a fast growing Internet Shopping company in New York City. Jules is very much ""work focused"" and has zero balance in her life. Her company, About the Fit, starts a senior intern program. Why, probably something to do with appearing ""not agiest"" but we are never given any explanation for this. Seventy year old Ben Whittaker (Robert DeNiro) is a bored, retired widower. He applies for the intern position and gets it, having to help Jules with her day-to-day business.

The movie has great messages of successful women in the workplace, seniors still have wisdom to impart to young adults, and that men and women can have plutonic friendships without love or sex. However, the sloppy screen writing takes these messages and covers them with cheese and clichés. The company is the stereotypical company of today: loaded with hipsters, the office looking like a loft, people dressed casually, etc. The movie is loaded with product placement from Apple, Audi, Samsung, Stella Artois, etc. Ben and Jules have no real conflicts or disagreements. The two have too smooth of a relationship. The conflicts feel more manufactured to fill the two hour time frame. It should have been cut down to 80-90 minutes. The characters are one dimensional and flat. Even in the end, when the true conflict finally does happen, it wraps itself up too easily and comes across disappointing that it doesn't go in another direction, especially with the ""successful woman"" mantra the film tries to illustrate.

It would have been nice if DeNiro's Ben had some flaws or shortcomings that Jules could have seen as well as all the great qualities as well. You learn from both things in most friendships. It also would have been nice if Jules had to make some hard decisions or sacrifices to grow her business. In the end, she doesn't, and it continues that message of you can have it all, which most of the time, you can't, but I guess you can in the movies...

No, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and there were some good scenes here and there, some small laughs, but very paint by the numbers in many ways. I like the messages, but I think there's a way to get them across better without beating the audience over the head and dumbing down the material.", 8/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful.

StevePulaski,"The generation gap, sociological commentary, and great narrative structure all in one film Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a retired man in his seventies, working for a phonebook company for decades and as a marketer for a larger firm. His talents and old-fashioned state of mind kept him employed for many years, and though he has found retirement relaxing and mentally freeing, he is still antsy in his every day life. He wants to do something big, but can't figure out what that something should be.

He decides to apply on a whim for a senior internship program at About the Fit, an e-commerce fashion company run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Upon getting the job, he accepts a position as the intern for Jules, even though she states that she will have little for him to do. As a result, Ben begins helping around the office and eventually catches the eye of Jules, who notices his outgoing, selfless personality, his gentlemanly ways, and his talents as an everyman. With that, Jules begins using him as her driver and an assistant scheduler, but despite this, Jules is juggling an immense amount of responsibilities. Her company has hit its five-year-growth-plan in a matter of nine months, and even with a staff of two-hundred and twenty people, they are struggling to keep up with orders and hold on to this exponential productivity and growth. Jules, who is also a wife and mother of a young girl, is told by one of her assistant mangers that they are thinking of bringing in a CEO to help Jules make managerial decisions and run the company, something she fears will rob her company of its core ideology and grassroots plan. Stressed and out of options, Jules utilizes Ben's versatile traits to help her in a time of need, and the two strike an amiable chemistry.

Nancy Meyers's ""The Intern"" ranks up alongside Noah Baumbach's ""While We're Young"" for one of the year's strongest comedy-dramas, and it's interesting to note how both films pose telling insights as they portray the post-World War II/baby boomer crowd clashing with the millennial generation. Ben's choice to dress dapper, even for a casual job, in addition to his age-old wisdom are thing that startles the youngbloods who work at About the Fit, and even his ideas throw the young crowd for a loop. His refreshing honesty and common sense approaches to conflicts are something a generation raised on the impersonal communication devices of email and Twitter find so preposterous that they're brilliant. Instead of portraying the newer generation as stupid and incompetent, writer/directress Meyers shows them as people victim to convenience instead of directness.

With that, the thoughtful, sociological examination of men and women here is something I didn't expect with this film. Consider the scene in a bar, which has been shortened to the scene of Jules questioning her employees about how, in the span of one generation, men have gone from guys like Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford to ""boys,"" as she puts it, in the trailer. I found the scene trivial and grating in the trailer, because the same argument could be made for women in a different light, but upon seeing the entire film, or the entire scene for that matter, Jules brings up an interesting observation about men and women in the current generation.

Jules states how women have been nurtured and taught (not coddled) to be empowered and determined to strive above society's gender roles, which is why you see women starting companies, becoming the breadwinners, and proving they are more than submissive housewives. In the process, she asserts, men have lost the kind of individualist determination of fitting into the box of masculinity, which is why you are seeing more men do things like playing video games and accepting less laborious forms of work. They were the ones previously schooled to believe in hard work and leadership, but seeing that role shifted has allegedly created a new contrast. Agree or disagree, or contemplate it, as I have been, this is a profoundly big concept for mainstream Hollywood film to make and this idea is carried through the film in a way that's not condescending, but enlightening.

Even take it a step back and look at Robert De Niro, an actor who was said to have lost his way in the early 2000's with easier, less compelling roles, only to rise and accept a whole new breed of roles in films like ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Now look at Anne Hathaway, a rising star in the 2000's who subsequently found a way to fade from the public eye, perhaps showing the contrasting longevity of an actress to an actor. It goes without saying that their performances and chemistry here is simply remarkable, as Meyers predicates it off emotionally honest conversations.

Finally, Meyers structures the film in a way that has its focus shift from being very broad to very specific by the latter half of the narrative. In the beginning, we see the grandscale setting of the About the Fit office and all its employees, before slowly but surely settling into focus on the two lead actors in a seamless manner. This smooth concentration allows for a nice narrative shift that doesn't make for jarring unevenness and it's something that editor Robert Leighton will get far less credit for than he deserves.

""The Intern"" is a pleasant surprise for a drama, as many dramas boasting big actors fail to impress and audiences are left with the optimism that independent films will pick up their slack. It's truly amazing to see a mainstream film tackle so much in the way of the generation gap, sociological commentary, and strong narrative structure in a film as unassuming as this. Minimize the level of outrageous situational humor (which, despite being a bit strangely placed - the scene with the email specifically - does indeed work) and this film could easily something Alexander Payne would make.", 10/10,"2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although the characters in this movie naturally are confronted with setbacks and disappointment they deal with it in a positive way without being confronted with hell on earth and being over dramatic. It encourages the believe: ""Suppose it DOES work ..."". Have fun!

ginocox-206-336968,"Amusing but not hilarious; tries to be relevant, but unfocused ""The Intern"" is amusing, but seldom funny; pleasant, but seldom engaging; thoughtful, but not cathartic. It toys with a lot of liberal, socially relevant issues without presenting any concrete ideas in a convincing manner. It attempts to be a romantic comedy without being a romantic comedy.

The idea that is given the most attention is that older, experienced individuals still have a lot to contribute in the workforce. Robert De Niro plays Ben, a retired production and marketing executive who worked in an obsolete industry and who is considered obsolete himself due to his age. But he's highly intelligent, experienced, wise, cautious, persuasive, somewhat charismatic, astute, etc., etc., etc., and has a lot to offer to Anne Hathaway's Jules, a hard-driven entrepreneur who is in over her head as a victim of her own success. Ben eventually proves himself invaluable to the company and, as the consummate team player, helps to spotlight the overlooked talents of Jules's assistant and three other interns. His reward is apparently for Jules to decide she wants to keep him on as an unpaid intern. She never demonstrates her character's growth by effectively utilizing all the talent available to her and instead continues her commitment to principles of micromanagement.

The film presents numerous other notions, including the Horatio Alger notion that if you listen to your customers and give them what you want, you will reap immense rewards, and Polonius's advice to be true to yourself. Nothing is so broken that it can't be fixed and nothing is so fixed that it can't be improved. A woman can be successful in business and still be a wife and mother. It has nearly as many homilies as ""Poor Richard's Almanac.""

Jules must overcome various challenges. One central challenge is from the venture capitalists who want her to hire an experienced CEO to run the company. These are the guys who control her purse strings. She needs to invest in warehouses and computer systems and personnel. These guys have pumped tens of millions of dollars into her business and she needs more money to keep it running. But they are worried about their money. If she rejects their advice, they could limit her access to funds. But we don't see the consequences of her decision. Is she able to convince the bankers of her way of thinking?

At another point, she has to confront several simultaneous disasters, including a product recall and a major systems bug. Rather than concentrate her attention on the problems at the office, she is distracted by a personal disaster and wants to reassign her systems staff to solving it, which is a major conflict of interest and would certainly shatter the venture capitalists' confidence in her. Ben comes to the rescue with an unconventional solution which leads to an amusing scene, but it means the talent she needs to learn to draw upon is taken out of the equation and we never learn how she handled the simultaneous disasters.

The film feels like it wants to be a romantic comedy and has several trappings of such. There is a bromance between Ben and the other interns. There's a romantic subplot between Ben, played by De Niro (68), who is pursued by Patty (Linda Lavin (78)), but hooks up with Fiona (Rene Russo (61)). The subplot adds nothing to the story and seems to be there only as an excuse to avoid any romance between Ben and Jules (Hathaway (33)). Meanwhile, Jules's stay-at-home husband has a dalliance with a girl who has about as much screen presence as Suzanne Somers in ""American Graffitti."" An office romance between two supporting characters also adds little in terms of plot, character or humor. It seems as if something more could have been done with the romantic subplots. Matt's inamorata could have been fleshed out to give Jules some actual competition, raise the stakes and require her to develop as a person to overcome the challenge. With so much to say about office policies, the film has nothing to say about the two office romances. Ben dumping the cougar for a younger woman is vaguely amusing. They could have pushed the envelope a little with Jules pursuing a measure of revenge on Matt through a liaison with Ben.

Ben's character seems a bit contrived. He recently retired from a successful career, but seems to know next to nothing about computers. His friends are dropping like flies, but he is in excellent health.

Overall, it's a pleasant film that seems a little unfocused. There are numerous socially relevant topics, but none are developed satisfactorily. It tries to be funny, but also tries to be serious. Good performances, particularly by De Niro and Hathaway.", 7/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Successful, sweetly observed comedy from Nancy Meyers STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a seventy year old widower from New York, who answers a job vacancy for a senior intern at an online fashion agency, run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), in order to give some direction and meaning back to his life. At first, he couldn't look more out of place in the modern open plan, tech savvy work place he now occupies, but his old school ways eventually endear him to his co workers, as well as Jules herself, until Ben becomes her driver and she finds his age and wisdom coming to save her in her personal as well as professional life.

The pace of technology over the course of the last forty to fifty years has accelerated to the point that the modern world resembles something of a science fiction movie come to life, and one in which the older generation would understandably feel quite bewildered and overwhelmed by, and this is the inspired premise that Nora Ephron chooses to explore in this gentle, bittersweet comedy, that eschews an old fashioned charm that isn't to be found in many films of the genre these days.

In the lead role, De Niro excels as the kindly old widow with advise and wisdom to dispense in droves, in a role with similarities with, but a complete contrast to, his role in the execrable Dirty Grandpa, which actually followed this. While he seemed totally out of place and degraded in that film, this is a part he fits much more comfortably, which suits his personality and talents a lot better, allowing him to create some genuinely decent chemistry with co star Hathaway and the rest of the youthful cast, which works wonders.

By creating a genuinely inspired concept and not just nose diving for cheap laughs and crudeness, it's paid off for Ephron and she's created a hugely rewarding and successful comedy that will manage to generate equal appeal to audiences young and old alike. ****", 10/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Figgy66-915-598470,"Great Movie, a relaxing watch 5 October 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Intern. A lovely lovely film. I'm am a fan of Anne Hathaway but not so much Robert De Niro, so I decided to give this film a try, so glad I did. It's one of those feel good movies which amble along at a gentle speed, fairly predictable but the storyline meanders enough to keep you interested. Hathaway brings her usual quirkiness to the character and De Niro plays a wonderful father figure with the most expansive array of facial expressions which brings lightness and comedy to the film. The addition of Rene Russo as Fiona the In House masseuse was fab. A very relaxing story to watch which left me feeling I'd not wasted the last couple of hours. One of those films you could watch again and again and still enjoy.

Catocala,"Great acting and an original plot It's so nice to have a comedy about older people without it revolving around the getting old, but instead on how others can view you as ""old"", which this movie depicts with great flair. The acting by both DeNiro and Hathaway is super and one of the biggest reasons this movie is so fun to watch. The character played by DeNiro seems a bit too flawless to be overall believable, but he's charming enough to get away with it. It sometimes becomes a bit too sappy where it could have been funnier, but it remains a good movie to watch!

What happened to the world?

Is this only USA problem?

I have been reading several reviews here.

And many people gave this movie a very good note.

And even sometimes very complex reviews.

There is NOTHING complex about this movie.

Sure, Robert de Niro is Robert de Niro.

And I must say the scenario is less horrible than the one of It's complicated.

But boy, Nancy Meyers knows how to write a commercial movie.

Take the assistants, there is nothing less accurate than how they talk.

Anne Hataway seems to have found back the acting of her Disney years. Nothing true perspires from that.

This movie reminds me of Meg Ryan's best years. A good way to not think.

Yes, the movie talks about real interesting issues. But it turns them into an over-egged pudding, just like Hollywood does.

And yes, it is watchable. The same way an ice cream is eatable, a cigarette is smokable and a whiskey is drinkable.

May not be healthy but tasty.

Now I don't wanna sound too negative.

That is why I offer to leave you with titles of movies I find are a healthy way to use 2 hours with :


Yi-Yi, a One and a Two



Trois couleurs : Bleu



Burnt by the sun



La Maman et La Putain


and maybe you wanna laugh, so :


The Meaning of Life



The Invention of Lying



Les Bronzés.

Little_C,"The Handkerchief OK, I'll try to be short and sweet, because there are many other reviews at this point (107/108, somewhere around there), so I'll just give you my pros and cons about the story, and also how some of the other reviewers missed things in the movie (in my opinion).

First of all; why The Handkerchief, instead of the real title? Because it isn't as much about the intern Ben Wittacker himself (Robert DeNiro), as it is more about Jules Ostin (Anne Hatheway), and the role of men and women in modern society. The handkerchief is a symbol of lost values which Ben reintroduces with a younger generation, along with other (little) things. Pivotal in this was the scene in the bar where Jules makes the observation that girls become women, but somewhere along the line men became boys. This sums the problem men face in today's society.

Furthermore; the relation between Ben and Jules; from scene one it was clear that Ben wouldn't do much growing, or have a huge story-arc in this movie; he was the mentor for the group of people from the get go. The real growing was done by Jules (and in lesser part by the staff surrounding her), but this part was the most disappointing for me because (SPOILER AHEAD) she forgave her husband for cheating on her (bullshit about feeling emasculated and so on). I hoped that she had found the confidence and power to kick his sorry b-hind to the curb, because she and her daughter would be fine without him (being her daughter being almost a carbon copy of her).(END OF SPOILER).

Was the execution flawless? No, it had it's minor difficulties, such as a weird break-in scene, and the thing mentioned above was for me such a big thing that I subtracted two points instead of one for the little things.

So, here's my two cents, see what you do with it.", 2/10,"2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

matthewssilverhammer,"Pleasant The Intern is like a mild salsa: filling, healthy and satisfying without a whole lot of flavor or fear of heartburn. Luckily, that potential blandness is rendered effective through some gentle melancholy, soft humor, and genuinely entertaining performances throughout. Instead of another shallow dramedy, we're presented with properly complex adult issues, like aging, loneliness, marriage, and career, told with sincerity and a healthy amount of Hollywood heart. The tone can be summed up in one word: cute. Sure, it's a comedy, but its jokes don't really inspire uproarious guffaws as much as they do crooked, polite grins. This isn't an altogether bad thing, as we watch the blossoming friendship between distraught internet mogul Hathaway and her aged apprentice, De Niro. Their relationship at times feels a bit forced, overly quirky and predictable. While this renders the movie a little long (2 SOLID hours), the centering presence of the surprisingly likable De Niro pushes this above your average PG-13 comedy. Director Meyers has always made movies whose highest aspiration seems to be ""pleasantness"" (The Holiday, The Parent Trap). Up until now, I've yet to find her slight brand of grown-up humor appealing. The Intern isn't much different in spirit, yet somehow it works. Sure, it was a bit awkward at times, like a person acting too young for their age, but along with the gentle jokes and personal drama, there are actually some nice visual flourishes in the crisp editing and directing. Much like last month's pop hit, The Intern's inoffensive brand of entertainment will fall right off your brain when you leave, yet be catchy and familiar enough to divert you during its runtime.", 1/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

dcreed,"Had High Hopes I really had high hopes for this movie, based solely on the cast and director/writer. Unfortunately...meh.

Somewhere along the way they forgot they needed a plot rather than a meandering set of vignettes and half-baked sub-plots. All of which get tied up neatly in 30 seconds at the end, leaving everyone exactly where they started. It's almost as if on one of the days of shooting someone said, ""We've got enough footage: let's see if we can edit this into a decent movie.""

They couldn't.

Hathaway and DeNiro are, of course, excellent. It's just unfortunate they don't have anything really solid to be excellent at in this semi-coherent storyline. Some of the secondary actors really shine, too.", 6/10,"2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

If you are up to pay for high class actors' vacations, then this is the movie for you.

If you are all about getting money taken out of your pocket for the sake of it, then this is your movie.

Melissaslist,"Could Only Watch 10 minutes This was on HBO's so I watched. I had seen the trailer and it looked cute and a premise I'd never seen before. I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. Maybe that is not giving it a fair shot, but my 10 minute rule has never failed me. If the first 10 suck the rest will most certainly be worse or way worse.In the 10 minutes I did manage to stomach I was embarrassed over the absurd rudeness of Hathaway's character. If the company decided to have this ""intern program"" she could at least pretend to be on board with it. Instead she is ageist and insulting and IMO not convincing. Amanda Priestly she is not. Even though Amanda Priestly was a cold hearted bitch at least she was an entertaining one. It just came across as false to me. The whole exaggerated idea that young people know everything while older people know nothing was also an insult and just wrong. Sure younger people are more in touch and in tune with technology all that is new...but older people provided they are healthy can be just as aware. Also the background music was completely annoying and reminded me of a bad 80's movie

piercejeans,"I wanted so much more The premise is excellent. It did not wind up where I thought it would. I did not expect DeNiro to get the girl. And he did not, that is, not as a lover or wife. But, the movie went nowhere. It basically ended exactly where it began. That is, a successful entrepreneur female with a husband who has an affair and is rattled by her busy life finds a part of her life instilled with peace and balance by a father figure of Bob DeNiro. The movie ends up the same in the end except that DeNiro (Ben) is now a part of their lives and has come to add a much needed father figure status to Hathaway's existence.

What I had hoped for is a few twists, maybe some laughs, and perhaps some inventive rewarding plot developments. There was none of those things. The script is dead. The actors and the production itself is first class, A category, and very well produced overall, except for the lack of a great script. This is a nice script. This is a movie for a Saturday afternoon when you feel like just relaxing in and not thinking about a lot. Maybe that is enough.

Imagine if Ian Fleming's Goldfinger in 1964 was produced as it was, but the script only developing James' character, and showed no real plot or action. Maybe if Goldfinger was never encountered, there were no chase scenes, and Oddjob did not chase Bond all over the movie set. Just a snapshot production of the life of a secret agent. The girls, the bars, some of the gadgets, but no story. Kind of the same thing here.

What COULD have been done? I never wanted DeNiro to get the girl or have an affair. I did expect him to be the in name only CEO of the company, and I imagine some funny situations could have been made when Ben attempts to fool the investors that he is in charge and experienced in fashion enough to safely direct the company. He could have accidentally produced a new fashion, or killed off an existing one. He could have stumbled into a genius success at being a CEO while not bumping off the protagonist. Imagine if the founder was not around and not reachable, and some important decisions had to be made. Imagine if he accidentally made the right ones. You get the idea.

This is not a comedy. This is a mug of hot chocolate. It is a cross between a drama and a romance. I am convinced if Robert DeNiro had not played the lead, this film would have flopped and gone nowhere. I think the movie betrays the audience. They expected more. I think a Carol Burnett class of comedy writers should have been brought in to give this script the shot in the arm it needed. Nuff said.", 6/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful.

prowalt-147-891879,"One of the worst and longest agonizing movies ever I watched the whole thing! My bad. I was hoping it would get better at some point but it just dragged on and on and on endlessly. Robert DeNiro deserves the worst actor category of 2015 and Hathaway is not far behind. However watching DeNiro is just embarrassing. Having gone from one of the best actors in film to possibly the worst is just hard for a movie fan to take. Can't he just retire with some dignity? Does he have to made a fool of himself with all the trash he appears in lately? Does he need money that badly? We should all have a charity fund for him rather than watch him become a grade ""B"" (no make that a grade ""F"") actor. It's hard to watch!

steven_torrey,"Imagne going through life without having read Shakespeare or Martin Buber People make disasters out of their life. It is a rule of life. It is inevitable. That's why these people consult others who have read Shakespeare and Martin Buber--they are the ones who clarify for the confused.

Jules Ostin --Anne Hathaway-- is 32 year old dot com entrepreneur; one of her assistants has suggested a senior intern program for retired employees--enter Ben Witaker--age 70 --Robert De Niro. I found the movie warm, endearing, charming; a sleeper like Penny Serenade or Miss Pettigrew Lives for Day. A lot is going on that the audience misses.

For example, Jules has sent an email accidentally to her mother. She immediately goes to her tech squad--who sure enough look like

killers--to see if they can break into the server and delete the email. This is most likely illegal, and most likely very difficult to do. Which her computer geeks tell her. Ben comes up with the bright idea to break into her mother's house, intercept the computer, delete the email. Also illegal, but doable. It's low tech, that a 70 year old would think sufficiently feasible. The other 3 younger interns are corralled into this adventure--and one of them immediately thinks of George Clooney's (horrendous) film Ocean's 11; Ben doesn't even think to remind them that Clooney's Ocean's 11 is itself a riff on the 1960's excellent film Ocean's 11 with the RatPack--Sinatra, Martin, Davis, etc., Now that allusion is funny. The whole scene was high and low comedy revolving around the computer wizardry.

It's tempting to see this movie as a conflict between the older generation born when people actually spoke to each other face to face and the newer generation that communicates via cell-phone, email, video recording, etc. It's easy to see the movie as presenting some kind of conflict between old school and new school. In fact, in the move, Ben points out that the Brooklyn building she uses for her company, once housed the telephone book publishing company Ben had once been a manager in.

But the leitmotif is stated at the beginning: Plato--Aristotle's Theory of Ideal Forms. Jules is involved in creating 'ideal' for people to attire themselves in; this occurs in the opening scene about an ill fitting bridal gown. And Jules attempts to fix, to fulfill this 'ideal form'. It is a dance interweaving itself throughout the movie that propels the movie forward.

Jules doesn't need Ben--it just so happens that Ben is very helpful, very insightful, very machismo in that way that 70 year old man are machismo with self-confidence from having lived a righteous life.

I wanted Ben to be named CEO--that would have been perfect and schmaltzy; the director--producer saw something different. The movie works; it's a sleeper.", 8/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

burlesonjesse5,"VIEWS ON FILM review of The Intern 2015's The Intern (my latest review) is great. There I said it. This is feel-good, cotton candy people. You stagger out of the theater with a sense of giddiness. Then you say to yourself, ""wow, that's a real film"". Its lead (Mr. Robert De Niro) has never been more likable. You wouldn't even know it's the same guy who played psychotics (Taxi Driver, Cape Fear), hardened criminals (Heat, The Family), and ornery grandpappys (Meet the Fockers, Little Fockers) some years ago. Crazy. With his co- star being Anne Hathaway (also very likable), screen chemistry is indeed abounding. A friendship develops between their characters producing an inner wallop. Now in all honesty, I don't ever cry at the movies. Here, I got the sniffles and that's saying something.

As directed by Nancy Meyers, ""Intern"" has one of her trademarks written all over it. That would be the adage of well-off people having problems (in relationships) that aren't life-threatening. You could also include the notion of two protagonists sharing scenes and being worlds apart in age (remember Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton in Something's Gotta Give?). So yeah this flick is cutesy at times. Yeah it ends with a level of uncertainty (talking about cinema makes way for interpretation you know). Yeah it starts off sort of predictable. Yeah it has some nitwit, supporting characters and yes, there's a cringe-worthy boner gag (don't ask). But look closer and stick around for the full two hours (despite what other critics thought, the overlength didn't bother me). There's something deeper than what was advertised in the trailer. Here's a hint and spoiler alert (warning): The husband of Hathaway's persona (Matt Ostin played by Anders Holm), isn't much of a shade and doesn't hold the screen until his revelatory stance hits you up in the third act. Talk about a plot diversion in a so-called, mawkish comedy.

Shot near the perky side of Brooklyn, New York and featuring an email heist referencing caricatures from Ocean's Eleven, The Intern is a romcom without the ""rom"", a centerpiece sledgehammering facets of old age (you could also throw in older people's spar with newer technology). The story starts off without a struggle or conflict before later kicking into high gear. You have Ben Whittaker (De Niro), a widower who just wants some higher form of human interaction. He's retired, he's traveled the world, he hangs out at Starbucks, and when walking down the street, he gets hit on by weird women (Linda Lavin from the TV show Alice, who'd thunk it). Sadly, this is not enough for him. The solution: He signs up for a community outreach program in which seniors intern for thirtysomething boss, Jules Ostin (Hathaway). Ostin owns a Internet fashion company, built from the ground up. She's initially reserved, conservative, and off-putting. And her first impression of Ben is that he's too observant not to mention a little invading. Then things change. As time marches on, De Niro's Ben and Hathaway's Jules form a wonderful kinship. They eventually turn into best friends. Refreshingly, it was great to see two Oscar winners thrive at the top of their game. When they're on screen (together or separate), ""Intern"" is a real winner. When they aren't in frame (which hardly ever happens), the material is sadly, a little sluggish and kind of hackneyed.

Anyway, if you've recently watched The Internship (2013), you'll somewhat be reminded of The Intern. Both films start off similar yet the latter ascends to something much greater. Bottom line: Chalk up another round of effective, sentimental goo courtesy of the veritable Nancy Meyers. I'm gonna go with a rating of 3 and a half stars on this one.

Of note: De Niro's Ben Whitaker has a need to fill a void in his life. He's retired with money yet is bored. That's why he takes on the task of working in e-commerce territory. De Niro the actor, well he seems to be filling that same void (Bobby's rich but still likes to appear in three to four movies a year). With endeavors like Grudge Match, Last Vegas, New Year's Eve, and 2013's Killing Season, he hasn't been too picky about his projects. The Intern thankfully, reverses this trend. Mucho ""De Niro"" justified!", 10/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

juneebuggy,"""I'll call you when I have something for you to do."" Liked this more than I expected to. Its an easy watch, set up like a romantic comedy except without the romance, not sure what those movies are called? A fish out of water, workplace comedy/drama following (a surprisingly likeable) Robert DeNiro as a 70 year old widower who decides to come out of retirement, mostly due to boredom and takes an internship at a trendy start up fashion company. Through perseverance and old school work ethics he becomes a confidant to Anne Hathaway, the overwhelmed young CEO. This was a really nice movie; DeNiro is very likable, nobody tries too hard to be funny and the storyline isn't sappy, it just flows... nicely

skymindlondon,"You're not short-sighted. There's actually nothing on the screen I hadn't fully grasped the meaning of the word ""agony"" until I went to the cinema last night and watched ""The Intern"". Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a cinephile, I have seen a few movies in my life and I have opinions, that's about it. What's amazing about ""The Intern"" is that there is not one single event unfolding on the screen that would provoke a reaction in the viewer. At some point I felt like checking people's pulses, as we had all been sitting there for more than an hour and I hadn't heard a single comment. This movie is a horrible display of stereotyped anthropology, both old and new clichés, with a sequence of facts narrated with no connection whatsoever between them. It doesn't make you cry, it doesn't make you laugh, it's just a two hour long placebo that you would watch if you were part of a control group in a lab. But at least in that case you would get some vouchers. Do not buy any snacks as you'll end up with appendicitis, cause you'll devour them all in the attempt of killing time. When you finally think the torture is over, a ""twist"" in the story makes you dread that you will have to watch the extra time of this stalemate between boredom and uselessness. One last warning: be ready for the cheesiest lines and shots you've ever seen. Close-up of toothbrushes to symbolize love, narrative stratagems that don't make any sense and a constant celebration of relationship in the most banal way are the main traits to this movie. The bottom line of ""The Intern"" is you should keep working like crazy and eat junk food, as long as you cycle in your own office, have a massive house in the heart of Brooklyn and make millions with the company you created. There is one good thing about this film though, and it was leaving the cinema to go home and watch another one.", 3/10,"66 out of 138 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

plumcreative,"Sweet, fun, and funny Not sure why critics did not rate this movie higher. It was sweet and funny. It made me laugh and tear up a little. I am glad I ignored the critics.

It has the feel to me of sweet funny romantic comedies of the late 30's and 40's but it isn't a romance.

The focus is on an older guy and how he relates to younger people— and visa versa. It reminds me of people I know, both young and old, who are open to listening and learning from each other.

Robert DeNiro was good. Not stellar but solid.

Anne Hathaway was also solid and seemed a little bit more comfortable in her role than DeNiro.

This is the kind of movie I like. Somewhat like real life with a mostly happy ending. The story was not all light and happy— it had sad parts— but that is life. Finding the good things in life and not letting the bad overwhelm you is really what it all about. Cheers", 6/10,"4 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

It is paced very nicely, and has some very subtly sweet moments indeed. The story unfolds well, and develops into a very enjoyable watch. The jokes and comedy wasn't overbearing. It is amusing and humorous in all the right places, and serious and emotional in others. All characters are played well and are very warm and developed. A well rounded film indeed. Loved it!

GAWeldon,"Is There a Story Here Somewhere? Have you ever watched a preview trailer and felt like you'd just watched the entire movie in 2 minutes? That's exactly the problem with ""The Intern"". If you saw the 2 minute trailer at theatres (or even the 30 second TV commercial), you've seen the entire film.

Robert DeNiro is a retired widower (""Ben"") who gets a job working as an elder intern for Anne Hathaway's hyper-busy internet start-up company founder/CEO (""Jules""). They eventually bond. Ben gets along with all the young guys and gals at the company. Ben ingratiates himself with Jules' family. He imparts wisdom and friendship. The End.

It's an interesting premise, but there's no real story here. There's no beginning, middle, or end to the story. It just starts, runs for about an hour and a half, and then just ends.

There's an almost-interesting subplot about Jules being asked to hire a new, more seasoned CEO to be her boss by the venture capital company that funds her company. None of the VC investors are shown on-screen. There's a list of 10 potential CEOs, but Jules only interviews 3 of them (all off-camera). Nothing really happens with this subplot.

There's another subplot with Jules' husband that was only a surprise if you've never seen any movie before. That subplot gets tied up easily, too.

This is a first rate cast, and I've enjoyed some of director Nancy Meyers' previous work, but this movie is just under-cooked and kind of meanders until the final credits finally appear.", 2/10,"3 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Seraphion,"Tight story, but shouldn't really be considered as a comedy The story is indeed a tight one as all those various complications got laid to rest with compelling conclusions. Nothing gets left out; even the smallest story detail gets revisited and settled. The thing is, all those settlements are predictably good conclusions; as if this movie is riding the tide of the current trends of Hollywood movies of no matter how hard the problems presented in the movie, the ending will still be a good one. Also I don't really think that the movie really suits a comedy genre classification since the comedies are merely there to spruce things up instead of being a major ingredient. There' no instance of a major laugh, no practical jokes whatsoever, and the jokes are actually only one- liners. The end one-third of the movie's duration just really didn't have any joke on them. The acting overall however is quite a good one. Robert DeNiro's acting proves that his old age can come in handy, especially to cross over to genres beyond his comfort zone of thrillers and dramas.Anne Hathaway did her usual catch for a character and played well enough.", 1/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Avwillfan89,"Quiet but pleasant This is definitely a huge change from the many movies I've seen lately, which included a hell of a lot of action and confrontation.

This comedy, although romantic, is not the stereotypical ""poor boy meets rich girl"" story, but about an aging intern, Ben, who wants to occupy himself at a new young-staffed company, which happens to be the same building he worked in for over forty years.

His boss, Jules, is a workaholic who forgets to sleep, eat and have fun. There are no bullies in the company, and everyone is cool to hang out with.

Robert DeNiro's character, Ben, is probably the nicest, sweetest and lovable characters ever. A dramatic contrast to the characters DeNiro usually plays on screen. He never gets angry once, and he only makes life better for the employees at the company.

Despite the lack of action, deep drama and pressing moments, apart from the hilarious scene where Ben and some boys try to break into Jules' mother's home to delete an insulting message on her computer, the film was lovely, easy to watch and uplifting.", 10/10,"2 out of 5 found this helpful.

His performance was flawless as always, but this candy coated, unbelievable movie ends with no realistic resolve or point and my wife & I were felt it was a complete waste of time. Life just isn't like this, and there was potential for this to be so much more. Can a movie simply be ""too sweet""? Yep, this was it. ""You're just never home, so I cheated on you. But forgive me and we'll make it work"". Downright silly, and quite a bit of the dialogue here was sickeningly sweet.

Even for girls how love chick flicks this would be boring. IMDb requires me to write 10 lines about this movie, but frankly, the whole script to this movie can be described in less than 10 lines. The best description of it, is movie about nothing. A wife, mom and CEO with a cheating husband cries and sais thank you for taking me back when her husband tells her that he has cheated, but has decided that it was not that good, and is ready to end it. Who writes this ?

To Robert De Niro, please, read scripts before you decide to accept a role in the movie.

Benjamin-M-Weilert,"All generations have something to offer. Cute and heartwarming on a number of levels, this film was nearly perfect (a few of the masseuse scenes were unnecessary and some of the plot twists were cliche). I'm not sure what I like most about this movie. It could be its perfect casting choices. It could be its natural and clever dialogue. It could be highlighting the importance of classical ""manhood"". At any rate, it shows that all generations have something to offer and once we get past the preconceived notions about a person, we can see what value they truly hold.

""The Intern"" has such a sweet story! It gives a positive message about seniors as they have much experience and wisdom on many aspects of life. Ben is observant, sensitive and says all the right things at the right time, therefore positively influencing everyone around him. He's such a charismatic and likable character. The boss is sweet as well, I really enjoyed watching it.

ThomasDrufke,"Breath of Fresh Air The Intern is a really refreshing film. Not because it's one of the best films of the year, it's not. Not because it has the best performances or directing, it doesn't. But The Intern feels different than anything I have seen this year. It has a senior intern for starters, but the mixture of heart and humor that The Intern carries is something special. It's a little long but Nancy Meyers does a great job in her wheelhouse, which is making feel good movies, and The Intern is most definitely one.

We begin by seeing Ben, played by Robert De Niro, struggle to cope with the daily life of a retired man who is living alone in New York City. He finds an ad for a senior internship program and the film takes off from there. Now, I think the film lives and dies based on how much you enjoy the two leads chemistry together. Anne Hathaway plays Jules, the entrepreneur/working mom, who is way in over her head with her job. Her and De Niro have wonderful chemistry together and that's probably why I enjoyed the film so much. There's something to be said about a relationship between a man and a woman that is zero percent sexual or romantic. The film does take on a certain amount of weight to the ageism angle that the trailer showcased, and those scenes for the most part worked quite well. They worked as good comedy relief and added to the uniqueness of Jules and Ben's relationship. I will say at times I felt fatigue with the ageism angle as it became the butt of the joke one too many times.

Aside from one really random and out of place robbery sequence, the film flows well. It could have been a little tighter, but it's a heartwarming movie for all ages. The comedy with the supporting cast works with Adam Devine and Rene Russo having key performances. The score is charming and hits at just the right times. But I think the best part about the film is the two leads and how great they are together on screen. Hathaway could have came off as a snobby businesswoman and De Niro could have mailed it in, but they both gave great performances. The Intern is one of the more surprising films this year.

+Score

+De Niro & Hathaway's chemistry

+Balances heart and humor

+Unique story

-Random robbery

-Little too long

dragoezcurra,"The actors/tress did their job, but the Director is another story. I believe you can write a mediocre story, but if you have top rating actors you can attempt to cover the flaws. The big problem is that the flaws of this movie are not within the main story but with the secondary ones. Robert and Anne story is beautifull with some scrtipt flaws, that we will speak of later but lets begin with tertiary characters first.

Cameron, has an identity crisis. Who is he? I had some posible asumptions during the movie, I thought, is he the villain? Is he trying to plot with the CEOs to take over the company? Is he secretly in love with Jules? Andrew Rannells, Also you can remember him as the evil band member in How I met Your Mother series, which fits perfectly becouse he does have a Villain face. The character and Actor do not fit. He is misleading.

Jason and Becky. We were introduced with a typical ""Problems in paradise"" plot between this characters. Are they back tocgether? Not?

Matt. This character is controvertial. This movie gives the impresion that tries to uphold the views of modern feminism. But at the end of the movie, it all comes down to basic RomCom built up, ""The man, runs to the woman, leaving everything he did aside to keep her"".

Jule's Mother. Another crisis without an end. Jule's mother doesn't say ""I love you"" back, the director doesn't seem to have interest in solving that, but does think the realtionship between them is important enough to make a whole scene in the mothers house, to which we don't hear anything else from the mother after the police went to the house. Fan idea: I hoped Jule's mother was the lady that follows Ben around, but Ben doesn't want anything to do with. That would've been so funny.

Sexual Tention between Ben and Jules. When they go to the trip together and they are in the hotel room, Jules offers Ben to lay down in the bed and she says ""Don't worry I'll sit on the couch"". After she doesn't, Ben says, ""I thought you were going to sit on the couch"". Why? That is unnecesary.

Paige friend doesn't want to be friends with her. If that was just a filler comment, we could let it through, but it comes back again and again. To the point it gave me the impresion that Paige's friend was the daughter of one of the moms that Critizices Jules. The park scene is just an excuse so Ben can see Matt cheating. But instead of trying to push how Strong and Independant woman Jules is, they could've made Ben comment about parent influence their child to not be friends with paige.

Overall I believe this move tries so hard to be unique but it can't separate itself from mainstream. Which ends up being just Awkward. This movie does not have an Identity.", 10/10,"2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

writers_reign,"It's A Wonderful Life (In Cloud Cuckoo Land) Depending on your cynicism-count you'll either view this as a great feel-good movie or Fantasy Island writ large. Consider: Robert de Niro is cast as the most perfect male since Jimmy Stewart in IAWL, the most lovable guy in town dispensing wisdom like ATMLs dispense tenners while Ann Hathaway is not only drop-dead gorgeous but has single-handedly built up an online fashion company from nothing to a place on the Big Board, is adored by her employees and adorable, not to say cute, small daughter and hasn't an enemy in the world.

Danusha_Goska,"Warm and Cuddly, Sweet and Funny I fell in love with Ben Whittaker, Robert DeNiro's character, in the first five minutes of ""The Intern."" Ben is a seventy-year-old retired telephone book executive. He's super competent, humble, kind, caring, and hard-working. His eyes twinkle and his cheeks are pinchable. He would make the perfect father, boss, or Santa. Ben Whittaker is writer-director Nancy Meyers' best creation yet. I didn't just like Ben, I found him believable, thanks to DeNiro's superb performance. I have to guess it's not easy playing such a nice person in a believable way.

Ben is unsatisfied by retirement so he takes a position as an intern at About-the-Fit, a fashion start-up, the brainchild of Jules (Anne Hathaway). Jules is impersonal and demanding, again, in a very believable way. Ben, worldly-wise and humble man that he is, makes positive changes in the company. He is a kindly mentor to younger male employees who rarely shave and don't tuck in their shirts. Ben explains to them why a man should always carry a clean handkerchief.

Anne Hathaway is so beautiful it's hard for me to assess her acting. I keep focusing on her face. I found her very believable as a driven businesswoman lacking in people skills. The movie softens her. There are scenes where she is revealed to have a toasty warm marshmallow heart. I was disappointed by those scenes and didn't find them believable or interesting. I wish the script had been as interesting and believable in its development of Jules as it was with Ben.

There are two relationships in the movie that didn't work for me at all. Jules is married to Matt (Anders Holm). I could see a really beautiful, driven woman married to a charisma-free, vaguely creepy schlub like Matt, so, yes, Holm was believable. I just didn't want Jules, this brilliant, talented, interesting woman, to be married to Matt.

Ben dates Renee Russo, and that relationship didn't work for me, either, although, again, it was believable. Ben has the wrinkled face and thinning, gray hair of a man in his seventies. Russo looks like a Hollywood actress fighting time, rather than like most real women her age. Also I saw no on screen chemistry between these two. Linda Lavin does look like a real, older woman, and she is in the movie as a predatory, mean and obscene old lady. There are cheap jokes at her expense. It's sad but not surprising that Nancy Meyers, a woman herself, depicted an older woman as an old witch, and set her up for coarse humor, and rewarded a much younger, and more Botoxed woman with romance.

""The Intern"" is one of those rare, recent movies for adults where nothing horrible happens. Nobody dies or behaves in a deeply despicable way or loses his cool and screams obscenities or knocks the movie off the rails. There are no body fluids on display. ""The Intern"" really is a feel good movie. If you are ever having a lousy day and you want to watch something that will give you a smile and make you feel good about humanity, please consider ""The Intern.""", 9/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

aiiine,"Sweet and heart touching movie 'The Intern' tells a story of a retiree (played by Robert De Niro) who, after being satiated with the usual life of a retired elderly person, gets an internship at the fast-growing fashion company, and the CEO of that company (Anne Hathaway), who is an extremely determined workaholic and is torn between devoting enough time to family and work. The intern's wisdom and support is very helpful and brings peace of mind to the constantly troubled boss.

In the wrapper of a light comedy and adventure film, it presents some ideas which would be great to every of us to take into account: not to label people and to know that there are always more factors to play than just standard stereotypes; it is never too late to start over and pursue your happiness; sometimes during your busy life you just need to stop and look around to become happier.

The film addresses two acute problems at once: the talent pool of retirees, whom no one wants to hire, despite their experience (or who are not taken seriously in the modern business), and the problem of balance between work and family for women entrepreneurs, who usually feel guilty for not being able to cope with everything. It realistically shows the problems and prejudices that these social stratas can face, without showing them ridiculous and inept.

The plot of the 'The Intern' is exciting and funny, it contains both wonderful jokes and heartbreaking moments associated with the experiences of the main characters; the acting and the director's work are also great. It is sweet and heart touching movie that will help recover your emotional well-being.", 10/10,"2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

socrates99,"Fun movie, even for hipsters I'm Anne Hathaway's worst audience, but now I've been bowled over too. What a fine performance! It's not so easy impressing someone while making them both laugh and eat their words. She is that rare female startup person you admire for her energy and smarts. Anne is genuinely lovable here and if I were casting her comic foil, the title's intern, I'd feel a bit anxious. Who could convincingly play opposite her? Whoever it is he's got to be someone this feminine dynamo can seem in need of.

And here comes the star of Taxi Driver, Ronin and Heat to the rescue. Not exactly the first person to come to mind for the part of the warm and funny gentleman who teaches these young people a thing or two about the value of old school. Truly, as good as Anne is, Robert De Niro is even better. I kept imagining the words of the script and was enthralled at how his performance made a living, unforgettable person out of them, one who never fails to get us to laugh.

I would have to concede this film is most clearly directed at my age group, the baby boomers, but I saw it with young people in the audience and though they didn't laugh as much as we did, they weren't at all sorry they'd come to see the film. It's heartwarming and smart and De Niro deserves an Oscar for his contribution.", 1/10,"2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Unrealistic escapist rom-com that will work only for those who love that stuff Robert De Niro has struggled to find good films or likable roles as 70-year-old actor, and accomplished rom-com filmmaker Nancy Meyers' helps the veteran get one of those right in ""The Intern."" Unfortunately, it's not the film.

De Niro's Ben Whittaker, a widower who finds that typical retirement life doesn't suit him so well, is as charming a character as the movies has ever given us. He does all the right things, he says all the right things, he wears a suit every day and smiles all the time. He's selected by the women's online clothing retailer About the Fit for their senior (as in senior citizen) internship program without so much as a hesitation.

All that's well and good, if you like rosy films with perfect characters that don't reflect any ounce of reality back at you. That's what Meyers has done with ""The Intern.""

The conflict in this film is all reserved for Anne Hathaway's Jules, the founder of the company who gets stuck with Ben as her personal intern/assistant and treats him coldly until she, like the rest of us, realizes how amazing he is. Soon he's navigating her through all the first world problems that come with being a wife, mother and CEO of a successful company. For those who inexplicably hate Hathaway, this film does her zero favors.

As pathetic as ""The Intern"" comes across in the context of things that actually matter in the world, Meyers (""The Holiday,"" ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give"") proves masterful yet again at giving middle-aged rom-com escapist moviegoers a story they can lap up like hot chicken soup for two hours. But while these audiences are happy to have their films devoid of conflict and intrigue, there's a more than reasonable argument to be made that all films need some kind of conflict and intrigue. What little ""The Intern"" has (for two whole hours!) doesn't meet the minimum threshold.

How a movie can have a main character whose biggest conflict in the film involves whether to reveal important information to the supporting character and get anyone to like it is a total wonder. Bravo to Meyers if her intent was to trick her producers into giving her money to make a feminist movie about a successful woman balancing work and life by making it appear as if she were making a film about an older male navigating a young person's working world. If that's the case, she's a genius, but if so, she doesn't do a good job of letting the audience in on the secret.

Regardless of any suspicion of feminist undercurrents, however, Meyers still managed to sell a movie with poor excuses for problems and the most banal of central conflicts, and she did it by making Robert De Niro look adorable.

Where everything is offensive and people are labeled all the time... Not even the cast makes you want to keep watching. And some of them are like nails on a blackboard. Also, they seem to be stealing too many ideas from other movies, with the same kind of premise. It's a big fat hit and miss.

I saw it and liked it when it first came out, but I've seen parts of it a few more times on tv during the pandemic and it's become one of my favorite movies ever! Partly because it's one of the few movies that doesn't need any cuts in order to be safe on tv on a Sat afternoon!

Robert De Niro's 70 yr old intern Ben and Anne Hathaway's uber busy company owner Jules are great together and the coworkers at Jules' company are very good as they all learn from and grow fonder and fonder of De Niro. It's not a hilarious movie, but there are plenty of laughs and smiles throughout.

As a woman of a certain age, I appreciate the generational give and take between Ben and the youngsters at work. Not enough to come out of retirement, for sure, but enough to be able to really relate. This is a feel good movie for when you just need a nice, chill story. I love it!", 3/10,"2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jfgibson73,"Plays More Like A Drama This movie begins and ends with shots of the main character doing Tai Chi in the park. If that sounds like an unusual choice to you, you're not alone. Take a look at some of the complaints that people have about this movie in the reviews and you'll see that it didn't do what they expected it to. When they see a comedy starring the funny old guy from Fockers and the young hip lady from Devil Wears Prada, they assume that this is a fish out of water story. The marketing leads them to believe it will be a clash between a young professional and a retiree that rises in action, then finds a tidy resolution just in time for the 90 minute mark. But like the people doing the meditation in the park, this movie is more about the continuation of life than a three act arc. The main character, Ben, becomes an intern at an e-commerce office where the owner, Jules, is overwhelmed. We are set up to expect several things will happen that never really do. At times, it is hinted that Ben will make hilarious errors related to not understanding today's technology, but he adjusts fine. We think he and Jules will rub each other the wrong way and hold the key to each others' happiness just out of reach, but Ben remains a capable support for Jules as she slowly figures out several of the issues she's dealing with. Throughout the movie, Ben's experience serves him well, a problem is solved, and life moves forward. It's a very Asian outlook, respecting elders and focusing less on conflict than continuation. Western audiences aren't trained to expect this, and that is not the only time their presumptions are turned on their side. There were moments that seemed to lead up to romantic involvement between them, only because other movies have trained us to look for that. It would have been wildly out of character in this story, but from the look of the poster, some viewers might have thought they paid for a romantic comedy. Fifteen minutes in, it was extremely noticeable that there hadn't been any gags, and that even though this was packaged like a comedy, it wasn't written to be one. This director allow the movie to be scored and edited as if the comedy beats were on the way, but this story reminds me more of the film In Good Company, which had the sense to arrive as a drama that happened to have some humor. Some people will pick up on these subtle inconsistencies, others will just see a sweet story about a nice old man and will get all they need despite an open-ended finish. I think it would have been more likable if it had a consistent tone, but it seems like the director couldn't clarify what she was trying to do and stick to it throughout.", 5/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful.

monstermayhem32,"A terrific movie The intern story tells with widower Ben Whitaker a retired print maker who realizes that retirement is not all that cracked up that it is meant to be, he ends up getting involved in an internship for retired senior citizens and works for CEO Jules who runs a fashion company, Ben happens to be well liked by the fellow staff and even teaches them some life lessons of their own. While the film itself is not breaking any new territory that is groundbreaking, but what makes the film so awesome is the amazing chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert deniro who are quite likable on screen together. What I found touching about the film is that you can do anything you set out to achieve as long as you believe in yourself and push to ones potential.", 1/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

eshwarmail,"A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads who are in top form Earnest performances from its talented cast manages to keep this mushy clichéd story afloat, but with its 120+ mins runtime - it definitely overstays its welcome.

Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired, widowed and restless. He joins an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) as a senior intern and quickly make friends with his old school charm and his caring nature. While Jules isn't initially kicked about the senior internship program, she quickly finds a friend and a mentor in Ben who helps her make decisions personally and professionally.

Nancy Meyers is quite experienced in this genre which is a double edged sword - while she handles it with a template old-school narrative, she also induces enough clarity and confidence that helps in the overall experience. Problem with actors like De Niro is that they have such strong histrionics, its hard to see them in character and this is where he is a revelation here breaking away from that with an earnest performance. He even uses his trademark scowl with a very different result. Anne Hathaway also does a very good job but it is something very similar to what she has done in 'Devil wears Prada' or 'Princess Diaries'. The rest of the cast if I am being too critical would say are a bunch of stereotypes stuck in clichéd scenarios. While it says some right things about the ecommerce startup industry, it is too muddled and superficial in depicting it on screen.

zanarymer,"Old man's fantasy This movie was so, so terrible. 2 hours long and absolutely nothing happened. The characters were all smiling plastic mannequins pulled out of a Macy's display, even Anne Hathaway who at least had half- baked attempts at depth. None of them were in the slightest bit believable, least of all DeNiro who was written as the perfect gentleman transplanted right out of the 1940s.

I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for something to happen, for even ONE joke to be made. I was promised this would be a comedy, after all. No. Nothing. Didn't even giggle once. The only sequence that even attempted comedy was painfully cliché and seemed forced, as if someone threatened the writer unless he at least tried to make this movie funny.

What you end up with is two hours of an old man dreaming about opening doors for some nice young lady who will admire him and tell her young male peers to be more like him and bring us all back into the glory days of men and why can't we all just be nice to each other without ever having anything get complicated anyway? **SPOILER** Our strong female businesswoman lead goes on a bizarre drunken Men's Rights tirade while DeNiro stands pleasantly beside her waiting to mop up her vomit. It was very, very uncomfortable to watch.

Watch this with your aging parents if you want to have a bearable time with them. Otherwise, go watch The Devil Wears Prada which is a similar movie with Anne Hathaway and a much, much better one all around.

Bonus - for a movie about a fashion company, the costumes in this movie were a snooze on their own. I don't care how relate-able they're supposed to be, people who work in fashion do not dress that boring.", 6/10,"6 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Red-125,"Ageist, tired movie The Intern (I) (2015) was written and directed by Nancy Meyers.

It stars two Academy Award winners--Anne Hathaway as Jules, the president of a large and successful fashion company, and Robert De Niro as Ben, who, at age 70, decides to intern at Jules' firm.

Writer/director Meyers has decided that there can't be any sexual chemistry between Jules and Ben, because Ben's too old. Ageist, but that means the plot has to go somewhere else.

Somewhere else is Jules whining and dithering over whether to hire a CEO in order to save her marriage. (Don't ask.)

Apparently, the producers believed that if you put two big stars in a movie, the rest will take care of itself. Wrong.

The Intern has a so-so IMDB rating of 7.1. I thought it was really weak, and rated it 5.", 10/10,"1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Usually the comedic formula is a few steady laugh out loud scenes followed by a slow degeneration into sentimental resolution, which is sickening enough to make the average Hollywood comedy disappointing at best.

This is a new low. De Niro's performance was awful, as well as the rest of the cast. Having said that, I retain a soft spot for Rene Russo, who is always top notch!

This effort was pure mush, dripping melted cheese by the bucket load. One of Dante's nine circles should be reserved for the team that commission and produce this sh*t!", 6/10,"32 out of 65 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

texshelters,"'The Intern' is run-of-the-mill heartwarming drama about a woman who makes good with an idea, a laptop, and a chair. It's the American Dream, you know. The Intern: A Perfectly Heartwarming film, and much much more!

'The Intern' is run-of-the-mill heartwarming drama about a woman who makes good with an idea, a laptop, and a chair. It's the American Dream, you know. Through a set of convoluted occurrences, the boss of an internet shopping company, thirty something Jules, takes on ""senior interns"" (people over 65) to work in her company. That leads to a series of 'surprises.' One surprise is that the old intern 'Ben' (De Niro) is not incompetent. Shocking! They learn that old people have something to contribute. How heartwarming! And the audience is shocked to learn that young folks don't have all the answers. Ben is so willing to help, you wonder where he has been all your life. All the heartwarming drama nearly gave me a heart attack.

Suffice to say, it's predictable. The film's efforts to tell a unique story fall flat. It is apparent that this is a star vehicle with a goal of making bank on the combination of De Niro and Hathaway on the screen. It doesn't bomb because of the expertise of the two stars, but the plot drags it down.

Ben, a goodhearted seventy-year-old retired divorcée, teaches the youngsters in the office new tricks. He effortlessly makes friends of everyone in Jules' office and knows exactly what everyone needs. He is the perfect intern. At one point of the movie, Jules (Hathaway) asks Ben (De Niro), ""Why do you always say the perfect thing?"" Why, indeed. He's too perfect and he brings no conflict to the table; in fact, he's boring. Sure, his homespun logic and chill advice are clever, and it is too obvious. But it is heartwarming.

The overworked self-made women (Jules) doesn't have time for anyone, especially herself, as she tries to keep her company running. But she's a loving and patient woman who adores her daughter, Paige. Her husband is the 'stay at home dad of the year.' Even when things go awry in their marriage, it's so damn heartwarming that it makes angels vomit.

Age barriers are overcome through clever, pat answers. A whiter-than-white cast stand insulated in a web of banal first-world problems. The major conflict in the film comes down to control and self actualization. Sure, in the context of Jules' life, it's important. For a movie, it's not terribly compelling.

I'm surprised the film turned out as entertaining as it did. It helps that they didn't throw in a last minute cancer, house burning down or earthquake. That is the rankest type of plot device and I am happy that I haven't seen that in recent dramas and romances.

In the film, it's all upper middle-class white America all the time, as if we were in the 50s, Leave it to Beaver version of Brooklyn, NY. I haven't seen a film this white since 'Boyhood.' Then again, an online vendor that sells clothing to ""housewives"" might attract mainly white college educated employees. Moreover, the film has to ignore class conflict in the 21st century in order to make Jules' problems at all dramatic. In the context of the world, her issues are trite and she is a pathetic whiner, type A personality who thinks her life amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Overall, it's handled by the actors: Rental

For all the blandness, the two stars pull of a decently entertaining film. But there is no reason to see it in the theater.

troy-manatunga,"Nancy Meyers best work; one of the better ones of 2015. There always has been a certain aura surrounding Robert De Niro. Very few actors to my taste possess the rare ability to be placed in front of the camera and demand almost immediate respect. Eastwood, De Niro, Pacino, Freeman and Walken are to name few. A measly plot, even weaker sub plot twists spells certain death for this Nancy Meyer screenplay. Astute acting and a factitious approach in direction do the trick. Nancy Meyers discovers balance and in that balance she achieves the flow in drama and humor that would get the wheels on THE INTERN rolling. To those that are familiar with some of her work this by far will easily stand out as her best work to date. It isn't a tangled ball of thread when it comes to sentiments although there is evidence of attempts to reach so. Instead it's a work on chemistry of two talented Hollywood A-listers that make this movie entertaining.

Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70-year-old pensioner. Having lost his wife 3 years ago Ben has now travelled the world but yet seems to have a void in himself that he is seeking out to fill. A senior citizen intern program for an online clothing line catches his eye whilst running his daily errands and he takes up the challenge and enrolls in the selection process. Jules Ortin (Anne Hathaway) the brainchild and the owner of the line is assigned Ben as her intern. Jules instantaneously is overwhelmed with a feeling of violation as the veteran comes across as too calm and too observant – something Jules is unable to neither fathom nor react to. Jules on her own is an individual who most certainly has too much on her plate. She is constantly late for meetings, she is always rushed and often requires to remembered of what is expected of her.

The 120 minute long comedy solely rides on the shoulders of Ben and Jules. Whose on screen chemistry is singular to the audience and is warmer with every passing minute. The weight of the minutes fall daftly on the audience as these two put on an amiable performance with Adam Devin pitching in for humor that ensembles flawlessly.

You will not split your side with laughter but certainly will hold belly with laughter. A good fit for date-night or just for some subtly family humor to get through the weekend. It's a Nancy Meyer movie – so don't worry she doesn't dig deep.

CCRider01,"Pablum For The Masses Boring overly sentimental drivel, how this film has a higher IMDB rating than the vastly superior ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (also starring Anne Hathaway) is mind boggling, but it does speak volume for the generic, overly PC world, we now live in, and the inability of today's audiences to sort dreck from average, average from good, and good from great. To see one of the greatest actors of all time, Robert Deniro, slip even further into ""Pay Cheque Bobby"", is depressing to say the least.

brutzel,"Slow moving and bland, bland, bland At 70 years of age, and a widower Ben (DeNiro) discovers that retirement isn't working for him. He hires on as an Intern at a dot com fashion house run by Jules (Anne Hathaway). Later he sees something he should not have seen and should he tell Jules?

Like many non raunchy comedies (the Airplane movies come to mind) all the good lines and jokes are in the beginning. After that it peters out and we are left with a soap opera. A very bland soap opera. This had a world of possibilities and went way south, in my opinion. Jules is a work-a-holic and she ends up using Ben as a calming influence.. Her company is on the verge of going broke and she needs to decide if she wants to bring in a retired CEO to help set the company on a better course. I expected Ben to use his business experience to help Jules find her way.

Oh, he does about 1.1/2 hours in and it's kind of glossed over. There needed to be more of this kind of advice. Didn't happen and we are left with a very slow-moving soap opera.

The best and only good line: Ben is being interviewed for the job and is asked, ""Where do you see yourself in 10-years?"" Ben replies, "" You mean when I'm 80?"" That's it folks.

The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway was difficult to gauge. Was it them, the script or the director? The chemistry was okay in a bland soap opera kind of way. See?

The company has a in-house masseuse in Rene Russo as Fiona and these scenes were uncomfortable to watch to say the least. Do these dot com companies actually have a an in-house masseuse?

Notable: Linda Lavin as Patty who has eyes for Ben

All in all the interview question above is the best part of this and there is no reason to continue. (4/10)

lucasversantvoort,"Flawed, of course, but very likable We've all been there: going to see a comedy and praying fervently that it won't be a complete waste of time. 'Please movie, don't take a hard right at Lame Jokes Avenue.' You hope that a feel-good movie would finally just do as advertised. Fortunately for us, Nancy Meyer's first film in six years does just that.

Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70-year-old widower who bluntly states that retirement has gotten way too boring. Even vacations aren't a solution, because the final destination, home, always reminds him of his wife. He realizes he has to stay active, do something...anything. He applies for a job at a fashion company that's looking for senior citizens (as a way to reach out to the community). The company's led by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) who's so busy that she's persuaded to scour for a new CEO. The investors are concerned that the company could potentially crumble under the weight of its own rapid success, so someone with 'experience' is recommended. Jules agrees to interview several candidates. Meanwhile, Ben, being an intern to Jules, doesn't have a lot to do, but soon finds himself becoming a mentor and a friend of sorts to Jules and aids her in overcoming not just the crises at work, but those at home as well.

I can't emphasize enough how crucial De Niro and Hathaway's acting is to the success of The Intern. Sure, De Niro's not venturing out of his comfort zone at all here, but he's believable and likable. Same goes for Hathaway. The supporting cast are a surprisingly likable bunch as well. Usually, comedies tend to suffer from characters who desperately try to be funny, but none of that awkwardness is to be found here. And that's what I found pleasantly surprising on the whole: just the complete lack of awkwardness, both in terms of acting and writing.

The film's flaws can all be traced back to the fact that, at the end of the day, it's very much a lightweight affair. You could argue for hours about how De Niro's father-knows-best role undermines the film's feminist side, that the role of the massage therapist is underwritten, yada yada. You could make a case that the film doesn't treat its topics with the dramatic weight they deserve and you'd be right--I personally felt that the 'cheating' could've been handled differently--but then again, the film never tries to be something it's not. The scenes featuring dramatic content are played out in such a way so as not to derail the film's overall happy-go-lucky mood and flow.

The critic in me thinks I should be harsher, but I can't deny that I had a swell time.", 7/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

russellingreviews,"A enjoyable and unexpected 'coming-of-age-again' film Is getting older a bad thing?

Walking into the cinema... It's not a rom-com and it doesn't have Melissa McCarthy in the lead role, could The Intern be a positive change for modern cinematic comedy?

Overall Rating: 3.25 stars Cinematic rating: 3.25 stars Bigger questions rating: 3 stars

Retirement has not been completely satisfying for Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro). As a retired widower, he misses his wife and desires to be reconnected to his previous life in the working world. Those connections with people and that feeling of accomplishment and purpose that drove him to get out of bed each day. At 70 years of age, he is given a new lease on life with a 'Seniors intern programme' at an on-line fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Ben comes to realise that some things have changed in the workplace, but many things are the same. Coming into this new job, his mentor is Jules, who is not too thrilled to have him working for her. While he is trying to find his place in this fast pace, high-tech world, Ben finds his place in the company. Realising he is there to help this young entrepreneur to find her place in the unforgiving world of business.

Director Nancy Meyers (It's Complicated) is known for her romantic comedies that involve those who are moving past mid-life. This business-centred story brings together multiple generations without diminishing the value of any age group. There is no need for the development of romance between the lead characters, but their eventual on screen chemistry process to be effective for the progression of this trainee tale. Meyer does keep a well-timed pace for the film and there are only a few moments where the story lags. Also, she delivers a comedic experience with integrity. The Intern is not reliant on excessive foul language or flatulent jokes to make the crowd laugh. Meyer manages to spin the central relationship as mentor/intern into something refreshing for a modern comedy. She capitalises on two Academy Award winning actors in the lead roles, but this becomes Robert DeNiro's film. He delivers the business savvy and vulnerability that make this role convincing and entertaining. Not that Anne Hathaway and the surrounding cast do not provide the needed layers for this story to deliver, but it required someone in the lead with the experience to pull it through to the end and like his film's character DeNiro gets the job done.

Meyer's internship narrative shows that individuals with a few more years under their belt may lack in the same energy levels as their younger counterparts, but make up for it with experience and wisdom. Thankfully there was a balance to the drama with the development of the relationships and characters that may leave the audience wanting more, but fully satisfied with what they received at the conclusion.

It is not ground breaking cinema, but it is an enjoyable journey into the value that each generation can provide for one another. Internships are meant to provide new experiences and insights for people. The Intern met this brief and in the process provided a few laughs, so that we do not take this life too seriously.

In the book of Proverbs it can be read, 'The glory of young men (and women) is their strength, grey hair the splendour of the old.' The Intern epitomises this verse in the Bible by showing the value of various generations. Showing that throughout this life, there is a tendency to look upon certain ages as having greater value than others. While this film and the verse communicate that each chapter in this life is new and the challenge is for each of us to take advantage of each opportunity that comes along. Some chapters may prove to be better than others, but ultimately each chapter adds to the overall richness of this life and challenge us to live each chapter as it is opened.

Leaving the cinema... I enjoyed this film more after I had time to think about it. It was entertaining and I enjoyed seeing it with my young adult daughters, who said 'it was a great date movie that makes you think more about life.' Good review, ladies!

REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about getting older? (Proverbs 16:3, 20:29) 2. Can each generation provide something in this life? (Proverbs 9:10-11, 13: 13,15-16) 3. What does the Bible say about aspiring to leadership? (Jeremiah 29:11, John 16:33)

kosmasp,"Going on As with De Niro himself, the character he is portraying, can and will not retire. Which is a good thing for us as viewers. While he won't do any action movie from now on (probably, never say never), which would be a wise decision, he can and does do comedies and/or dramas (the latter especially good with Jennifer Lawrence as leading lady).

This does work, even if it does sound like a one joke punch. And it is kind of predictable for that matter. What I didn't expect, that it would have such a high rating in the first place on IMDb. It's more than decent and it seems to talk to a lot of people, whether they identify with De Niro or Anne Hathaway. It has something for everyone, unless you see this as a propaganda film for capitalism of course ;o) Which I'd argue is not the case, but of course that's always in the eye of the beholder to decide.

TxMike,"Entertaining and meaningful, De Niro and Hathaway are great together. We watched this at home on DVD, a Netflix rental, so no extras, just the movie. We found it enjoyable all the way through and it has a good message about the younger generation not being so quick to discard the experience of the older generation.

Robert De Niro is Ben, in his early 70s, retired and recently a widower. He has a routine, he likes to be out and about, but he still feels somewhat useless. He had a long career and a high position, but manufacturing phone books became a historical footnote.

So he sees a flyer and it is for ""seniors"" to do an internship, unpaid I assume. So he makes his video resume', uploads it, emails it, and gets an interview. He is selected and he will work for the young lady who is the startup manager and boss of an internet-based clothes business.

That young lady is Anne Hathaway as Jules. She is smart and driven, and determined to keep the business growing. But she has a reputation of being very difficult to work with. Ben is ultra-chill and accepts her quirks and eventually works with it.

Jules and Ben become a team, he even becomes her driver, he gets to know her family, and eventually he becomes the substitute dad Jules needs.

It can sound a bit syrupy when described in a few words but the characters and script are well-written, the two leads are great in their roles. Also good is Rene Russo as Fiona, a masseuse that works during the day at the company. She and Ben hit it off right away and they have their own ""start up"".

As an interesting aside, it turns out that Jules' company is occupying the same building, the same space that Ben worked in for about 40 years.", 8/10,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

studioAT,"A surprisingly good film The Intern didn't seem to stay in cinemas that long, so I had my doubts when I picked up a copy of it cheap on DVD.

I'm pleased to say that I found it to be a well written and well cast film, that shone a light on a different type of relationship. I think Hollywood needs to take a lesson from this film and realise that not all stories have to be about people in their 20's.

Both De Niro and Hathaway give good performances, and their chemistry feels natural throughout the films a little too long length.

There are a couple of scenes that could have been cut (the email to the mother and following bar scene in particular) but on the whole I enjoyed 'The Intern' and would recommend it to anyone looking for a different type of film.

Westeire,"The Devil Wears Prada II So, its 7 years since she abandoned Meryl Streep in Paris. She has setup her own internet business selling cloths. (My imagination filling in the details). Honestly I didn't get this movie at all. Robert De Niro was good, some good laughs. But the whole story line was terrible. Do women honestly think this happens in real life??? At the end of the movie you are there wishing you have a bucket.. PLEASE get real. It was cliché after cliché.. The actors were good, but the script was bad and just got worse as the movie progressed. I think any successful women in business would find this movie a work of fantasy fiction. The first half of the movie is OK.. and then it gets worse and worse.

scottshak_111,"An upbeat pleasant movie Nancy Meyers has a knack for making 'pleasant and delightful' movies. The Intern is no different. The flick is upbeat. Almost like a fairyland, where good things keep happening, and everything is quite refined and elegant.

Anne Hathway is brilliant as Jules. With the backdrop plot of a girl doing really well with her startup, I imagined people of her character's age group instantly relate with her. What makes the story even more endearing is the inclusion of Robert De Niro as an intern who walks into the life of Jules as a fairy godfather. He comes as a pleasant surprise and makes things better for her, and takes the load off from her shoulders. Something tells me people are really looking for someone like De Niro in their lives. A friend or a watchful protector who just wants the best for you, and wishes good things to happen to you, who takes the driver's seat of your life and lets you enjoy the ride, and takes the pressure off, and also helps you out with the clutter in life.

Sadly the world doesn't really work like that. If it weren't so dark, each one of us would be living our fantasies without life's wretched inhibitions. The Intern is all a mere figment of Nancy Meyers imagination. She punches in forced comedy in order to make the matter in hand sound fun. Eventually she tries to create tension, which is again Meyers' way of putting hurdles into her story. Screenplay of the movie is more like conversations with a shrink. At one point, it seems you are witnessing one.

We must bear in mind, not everything in this life is plushy and fluffy. You don't always end up with unicorns and rainbows. Given the jovial theme of the movie, it would at once strike you how the director thinks. Nancy isn't a great director, but for some, she is.

I would recommend it for people who don't really like dark, who are light-hearted and are always down for a pleasant popcorn movie.", 6/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jordondave-28085,"The most unlikely scenario that is possible in a movie (2015) The Intern COMEDY DRAMA

Co-produced, written and directed by Nancy Meyers starring movie veteran icon, Robert DeNiro as 70 year old, Ben Whittaker coming out of retirement and eventually being accepted as an intern for internet selling sensation CEO magnet, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway)

It is the most unlikely scenario that a young internet sensation entrepreneur would employ the most inexperienced person about computers in general. Unless of course, if you are Robert DeNiro which a much credible scenario if both Hathaway and DeNiro were somehow related and were already made aware of one another, then yes that would be possible.

lavatch,"Worth Seeing for DeNiro Robert DeNiro has the uncanny ability of developing a entirely unique character in any new role. Based on the script of ""Intern,"" it would have been easy for him to recycle a number of characters from earlier films, turning on cruise-control for his performance. But he never dials in a single moment in this full-bodied interpretation of his character of the intern.

Ben Whittaker is a retired widower, having completed a successful career in business. But he wants to be back interacting with people and to be needed. Consequently, he successfully applies for the position of ""intern"" in a hip, internet sales organization run by a dynamic woman entrepreneur, as played by Anne Hathaway.

After his hire, Ben becomes the personal assistant to his boss, and film takes off with a fascinating and insightful relationship. The astute and experienced businessman has a great deal to offer the younger executive.

Unfortunately, the film takes a U-turn into the area of the personal when Ben observes the dysfunctional marriage of his boss and begins to offer her advice about her philandering husband. But the most interesting scenes were the business, as opposed to the romantic, affairs. The final stretch of the film was disappointing in the overblown sentimentality.

Writer-director Nancy Meyers was very close to developing an insightful film about the wisdom that comes from a senior citizen and the potentially useful role that retired people may play in advising the younger generation. Far from being a Willy Loman, DeNiro's Ben Whittaker is a robust and astute entrepreneur with an infectious enthusiasm. Consequently, he he is loved by his co-workers.

One of the best lines in Meyers' script was when Ben acknowledged that he was always able to get along with everyone. DeNiro builds on that line to masterfully create an unforgettable character.

Ben Whittaker may be a dying breed. But he is also indispensable for the knowledge he has gleaner over seventy years. That is an important lesson we may all learn from this film.", 1/10,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

FlashCallahan,"Breathe and relax for inner balance...... 70-year-old widow Ben is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position.

The founder of the company Jules, is a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic.

Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing.

But Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom......

The Intern is probably the safest film to be released this century. You could literally watch it with any member of your family, or work colleague, and there would be no embarrassment for anybody, because the film is just so pleasant.

The narrative should have had Jules depicted as a very cold, unapproachable person who gradually warms to Ben halfway through the second act, this is how these films usually work. But no, she is very pleasant from the upstart, and the one moment where she doesn't want to work with him just fades away with all the pleasantness.

De Niro is on form here, not his heyday form, but if you consider some of the material he's done just of late, it's pretty decent. His character reminds one of the Character Murphy played in Holy Man, he's always pleasant, never has a bad word to say about anyone, and is always at hand to help.

In fact, everyone is okay and fine at the beginning, and it's coasts along like this throughout its entirety.

Hathaway gets slightly stressed a couple of times during the film, finds out a horrible secret, and gets over it pretty sharpish, and it all finishes with the two main characters literally doing tai chi.

Throw in Rene Russo in a really worthless role as a love interest, and this is less of a film, more of a meditation or a counselling session.

It's not a bad film by any means, just truly uneventful, and just too pleasant for its own good.

It's the goody two shoes of modern cinema, and will definitely guarantee to brighten up the darkest of days.

Quietb-1,"Cast saves this one Here's a movie that suffers from the written and directed syndrome.. Nancy Meyers gets the credit and the blame for this one. It is too long with plenty of fat. The entire caper scene followed by the drinking scene when she should have gone home to the husband and child belonged on the cutting room floor. The San Francisco fire alarm sequence felt forced to meet the writer's need for the needed bedroom talk scene. And there was the on television scene from ""Sigin' in the Rain"" that made you wish you were watching that great film rather then this contrived one idea movie.

Hathaway and Di Niro make this watchable but they deserved tighter and better. After two hours everything is about where it was in the first five minutes. No need to see this in a theater as it will play well on a home platform.", 3/10,"1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Alanjackd,"Acting experience never grows old. Thought i would catch this to kill a few hours on a cold Wednesday afternoon between shifts.

It immediately grabbed me as a good old fashioned Sunday TV matinée that I used to watch many many years ago,,But 10 minutes in it changed into a fantastic masterclass in acting. Incredible performance from Bob DeNiro which could have been written for him in mind but for me Anne Hathaway completely runs the whole show.This is an excellent ""Coming Of Old Age ""movie which gives us just enough mush to keep a dry eye.( Well...most of us anyway).

The chemistry between these two was electric and the on-the -bed scene was done with loving taste with no hint of anything but friendship.

As a 53 year old male I could associate with the idea of having experience with decisions that seem over important but just need to be stripped down to black and white...the answer is usually in front of your eyes if you don't think too hard.

I've given it a very unusual 7 because this is a modern day classic for young and old.

Brings to mind Al Pacino in Danny Collins..a lifetimes acting experience served up with pure raw emotion.", 8/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Turned out to be the slowest film ever with no direction to it whatsoever! Great cast - thou they had to act through the worst plot and dialogue. Corny and overly sentimental throughout - had us all rolling our eyes on multiple occasions. Not sure what this movie was trying to achieve but failed on every level. So weird in places too - when she says to him your my best friend, when they sit on the bed together.. so strange. I am not sure what the other reviewers were watching! Feel like I have lost two hours of my life I can never get back!! Do not waste your time.

mehrdadjg,"Amazing movie to watch with your family Well, I just watched the movie and my only regret is that I should have watched it with my wife. Although It's probably okay, I'll watch it a second time with her later. I know I'll enjoy just as much.

I have loved Anne Hathaway in every movie I have seen of her. She once again did an amazing job. I'm not saying she deserves an Oscar for it, but I also wouldn't be surprised if she got nominated. She perfectly succeeded to capture her role: A woman who loves her job and her family and wants to make everyone who matters to her happy at all costs. Oh, did I mention she was great?

Where would the movies be today if it wasn't for Robert De Niro? Show me a single person who doesn't love him. I'm serious, show me!!! Once again he did it. He plays a senior intern in a huge up and coming company. That's all I'm going to say. I'm not going to praise him or say that he was good. I'm going to say that he is the soul of the movie and I loved seeing him. But that's just me, I love him in anything.

There are some scenes in the movie that kind of vaguely reference other movies that the stars have played. It was really fun for me to watch this scenes. There's of course the bride whose name is Rachel (Rachel Getting Married (2008)), the scene where Ben is talking to himself in the mirror (Taxi Driver (1976)) and of course my personal favorite, the airplane scene where Ben and Jules are chatting (Midnight Run (1988)). Gosh, I was so excited to think that He might do his iconic laugh.

All in all, this is an amazing movie that you need to watch with people whom you love. I assure you it will a good two hours, for all of you.", 7/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

What was up with the mom-daughter relationship? Why not elaborate a little on what was going on? The ""heist"" scene--you build Jules' character into this hard working woman, and suggest she'd reach out to her team to help with such a ridiculous problem..It seemed like at some point the writer decided that we needed adventure and threw this in because that's all she had. And the marital issue was clumsy..Very slow moving. The worst part--and the reason I had to write this review--was that ""The Internship"" was more entertaining EVEN THOUGH this movie had better first-rate actors. It almost seemed like Robert DeNiro was being a good sport and doing a favor in making this movie. Glad I rented.", 7/10,"3 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

DKosty123,"A For Age And A For Chemistry I kind of backed into this picture by watching the second half first, then going back and watching the whole film. Doing so gave me perhaps a different feel as I was kind of amused watching the latter though not quite sure what inspired it. When I went back and started it from the beginning, I was more impressed.

Robert De Niro appears to be making a pretty good comedy career in films now. In this movie he is 70 year old Ben even though he is actually older than the role he is playing here. He is the special Senior Intern at an Internet firm who comes in as a widower bored with retirement. So he signs up for the special program.

He comes into the company and immediately impresses everybody he is in contact with. Then he works his way into life with the CEO Jules played excellently by Anne Hathaway. The chemistry between these two is actually developed more into the second half of the film. Ben works on helping Jules sort out her business life and her personal life which are totally modern dynamic in different ways.

What this script does use effectively besides subtle humor, is the way the characters backgrounds are filled in, particularly Ben and Jules, as the film moves along. The circumstances of the film allow for character development which is rare in this kind of film. While the message that older workers is valuable for an aging baby boom operation, the more important message he is that technology is a thing that can be used to bridge generations rather than separate them.

This film is very effective in the emotional aspects of a life of having it all, and the prices of that. Rene Russo is very effective in support with scenes with De Niro here too. The messages here are comedy and the search for a happy life, and the fact that money and age are not really the answers to the happiness problems.

Sometimes a happy life is all in making the right connections. This film does that.", 6/10,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

nicolechan916,"Refreshing The trailer shows the potential for the film to be pretty comedic and though there are quite a few funny moments I wouldn't really call this a comedy. To me it is somewhere between a melodrama/comedy/drama type thing. I really like that this film goes against the patriarchal order of most films (and reality) by having a strong female protagonist. However, it does subtly hint at the question of 'can she really do it all?' which is a horrible question to ask as it undermines the female gender by saying women can't be successful at both work and home life. Plus, Jules is never seen having any other friends, implying that a successful woman can't have a personal life.

Hathaway gives a solid performance as a hard-working, always busy and on the phone type person with focused drive. She is believable as a person who manages to start a start up and make it successful. De Niro plays a grandfatherly type of character and puts the young boys to shame with his gentleman persona. Thus, with De Niro's grandfatherly character the film leans more towards a family film rather than a comedy. Not that this is a bad thing, as Meyers does a good job at integrating the different generations together and showing the lessons that each can learn from the other.

The look of the film is also very modern, and I like the cinematography and visual colours of the settings. Camera work does well in establishing the high rise buildings and modern architecture of the city (New York?) which parallels the fast paced generation of online companies. Additionally, the colours are very vibrant which add to the modern concept. The contrast between the mise-en-scene, and other characters place Ben as a creature in endangerment of being extinct, a dying breed of chivalry.

Although Ben's character does add some taste to the film, the ending inevitably ends with him (the white male) giving advice or having his say that inspires the solution. This reminds me a little of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, when the father (another white male) gives his verdict that everyone must listen to and agree on, though it is not so extreme in this case.

Overall, the film is an entertaining feel good movie for a relaxing Friday night.

ElMaruecan82,"Not much of a plot, but it's got a heart. And with De Niro and Hathaway, that's enough... A retiree in his early 70's still feels the 'music' in his heart and needs a job to keep busy and cope up with the recent loss of his wife.

Ben is the name and Robert De Niro plays the man in a heart-warming performance, reminding us how a likable actor he can be, given the right role. And since generation is a recurring theme in Nancy Meyers ""The Intern"", I couldn't help but think that he belonged to a generation that provided some of the best characters of cinema's history, many of them incarnated the tormented and rebellious youth of the 70's, and it sure tells you how time flies, watching Johnny Boy or Travis Bickle embodying a figure, whose respectability relies a lot on the age.

Let's get back to the story: Jules is the founder and manager of a clothes' online selling company, she's in her early thirties and tries to combine her private life (married with a child) and her time-demanding business. She belongs to the category of self-made women, Oprah Winfrey disciples, who regularly make the cover of female-oriented magazines, and I liked how the film, directed by a woman, didn't overplay that aspect, as Hathaway is totally opposite to the bitchy Miranda Priestley, who was her boss, ten years before in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". The young intern grew up and she has a more progressive view on management as her company hires senior people to do intern job and this is how Ben makes his entrance and what do you know, he'll change, if not everyone's lives, but their personal perspectives on life.

That's it, Jules is reluctant first but progressively, the help of Ben gets more and more precious and their professional bond develops into a genuine friendship that slowly transcend their generation gap. In the process, Ben helps also the other interns, providing them an example of how a man from the old school behaves. He's a guy who always wears suits and tie, who practices gallantry and whose presence reassures and oozes respect. This is a character-driven story without any twists or tricky situations of misunderstanding, and that the screenplay had the guts to avoid any artificial devices to make the story move forward (I expected at some part that Jules' assistant will turn into a villain) and keep on the same level of sweetness between the characters is a stunt I admire, it doesn't take risks, but that's a risk in itself.

It all comes down to one simple observation: ""The Intern"" doesn't have much of a plot, but it's got a heart, and that might be enough. I'm not sure every movie can get away with a similar story-line without sinking into corniness sooner or later, but this is where the actors' performances help. And when you have Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway playing together such common roles, well, an uncommon chemistry grows and it owes a lot to their positive personalities. And it works for a simple reason, these two persons have a generational gap, obviously, you can't be born four decades apart and expect to have similar views on life, and obviously Ben has a lot to teach and Jules is receptive. She has concerns, she worries about her life and she listens to Ben, and Ben doesn't take any pride from it either.

There's something I really liked in ""The Intern"" is that in a film that has all the reasons in the world to play the feminist card, you have a young successful woman who displays nervousness, lack of self-esteem, and emotional vulnerability, and it takes a man who belongs to the ancient generation to reassure her. This is very revealing of the twisted aspect of feminism and the preconceived ideas we have on our elder. First, Jules is totally aware that she's successful but listen to her speech during a party, the way she blames boys for not being enough of men, how we came to manhood models like Harrison Ford to geeky wussies is the trigger of her anger towards men. Many women take care of themselves because society has forged a generation of men who were too cowardly to take their responsibilities.

I was born the same year than Hathaway and while I don't consider myself a 'millennial', I reckon that the Internet, Facebook, simplified the relationship and never taught us to learn how to confront people directly, court a woman or break up without using a phone. There's not just a generation gap but also a gender gap that the film subtly points out, and the idea is that guys have lost the ability to earn what they achieved. And this is why Ben is sincere when he tells Jules that she's got nothing to sacrifice just to please her cheating husband or her employees, he doesn't see her as a woman but as a person who achieved something worthy of admiration. And this self-esteem, this capability to work your way through success is well received by the other interns.

In the context of a current cinematic trend encouraging a sort of clash between genders, saying that women are exploited, guys have the best roles etc. It is refreshing to have a film that doesn't go for the polemic and show these realities in a more partial and friendly way, it is full of positive vibes, and I liked it for that. Maybe I wish the film had tried to put a little more complexity in the plot and adds some nuance to the character of Ben who was might be too much of a boy scout and perfect for the role, you'd almost expect him to reveal that he's an angel. But in fact, the reason he put so much love in his work is because love and work are the two main drivers of life.

And that's what the film is about: love and work.", 9/10,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

dromasca,"enjoyable start-up melo Should I feel guilty? I really enjoyed this melodramatic, stereotype-rich, rose-water sprinkled feel-good movie which is 'The Intern', directed by Nancy Meyers, and bringing to screen the improbable pair of actors composed of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Now I need to find out why.

One of the reasons is probably the fact that the start-up and corporate environments are pretty familiar to me, and that their screen version as conceived by Meyers is not far from what I know. Yes, I have met the ambitious CEO working herself (or himself) to death at the expense of her (or his) family life, sleeping time and own health and reason. I worked and still work in 'open space' and 'glass-walled' environments. I lived through 'the sale of the day' and 'the hero of the month' and I understand what a good day and a bad day looks like in the shop that some believe it became their real home.

Then, I am a feminist. I sincerely believe that women can be better managers than men, and that they deserve all the credit when they succeed in the machoistic society we live in, and even more when they do it while keeping a family and raising kids who still recognize their mothers. For feminists this film carries the 'right' message.

Third (or maybe first) I am close to retirement. Not 70 yet, as De Niro's character is, not wearing suits and ties (actually I know a lot of 70-ers who never do), but yet, I can understand his panic when faced with aging, his loneliness and desire to socialize, his volunteering in order to continue to be useful and relevant.

The story of the 'retired intern' who becomes the best friend of the carrier-obsessed CEO by balancing the over-dynamic corporate environment with some old-fashioned common sense, the crisis of the millionaire teenagers with true sensitivity may have been told a few times. Yet it looks true on screen, or better said true enough to spontaneously generate the laughs and the tears rather than squeeze them. The actor who played all those tough gangsters in the first two thirds of his fabulous career has become the most generous and kind retired and his chemistry with flamboyant Anne Hathaway is perfect. Rene Russo is just the best known of a fun support cast. 'The Intern' will be criticized by many for taking life too easy, but if you are a fan of feel-good movies, or you just are in the mood of seeing one you would certainly like to watch it.", 7/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

avagaysmith,"A beautiful movie I was a little sceptical of this movie especially when I saw the length (2 hours is really long) and I was not quite sure what sort of plot could be developed to make it worthwhile. I must say that it was worth it. This was just beautiful. Beautiful, well developed characters. A story line with hope and promise and self-belief. I enjoyed how Robert De Niro's character fathered/grandfathered Anne Hathaway's Jules. It was a beautiful relationship. I loved that the film was 'clean' and pure and the little comedy in the midst of it all just sorta provided that well needed release that good humour tends to bring. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

SAMTHEBESTEST,"When a young-age success hires an experienced intern, only to learn the basic rules of the office called ""life"". The Intern (2015) : Brief Review -

When a young-age success hires an experienced intern, only to learn the basic rules of the office called ""life"". The Intern is a sweet little film with a sweet little thought and a sweet little process, but it takes a little longer than that little to make sure that you understand that little thought behind it. I guess I have summed everything up in one long sentence. The film is about a seventy-year-old widower, Ben Whittaker, who learns that post-retirement life is easy but hellishly boring. Seizing an opportunity to get back into the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin. As you expect, his presence makes things better for the office and, most importantly, for the young, dynamic, and successful Ostin, who had initially hated him. The script is predictable but not boring. Maybe those two hours look long, but for the first time viewing it isn't a big problem. The writing makes it easy for you, but then there is a goofy screenplay that makes it difficult for repeat viewing. There is no such big, thoughtful message in the film, so don't hold your breath waiting for it. Some of the old cliches work, some fail. That adult humour makes you laugh once in a while, and there are typical Nancy Meyer tricks with just the right dose of comedy. I loved that first massage scene and the Ocean's movie reference scene. The dialogues aren't great, but good enough. ""You are never wrong to do the right thing,"" yes, they copied Mark Twain's quotes, with credit ofcourse. Robert De Niro has performed well, but I think those repetitive expressions could have been avoided. Anne Hathaway looks damn beautiful in every single scene. She acts bad in some scenes, or was that a natural fumble? I am not sure, but the rest of the time, she is really nice. I am not a big fan of Nancy Meyers' films. I just watch them once and then forget them in a day or two, and I guess that's what's gonna happen with The Intern too. Nevertheless, it's a feel-good film with evident one-time watch values.

RATING - 6.5/10*

mikevonbach,"Great Film --I'm so sick of seeing SWAT teams with Machine Guns Nice relaxing movie Although for a minute there I thought De niro . Was Gonna Get Upset some when he saw Hubby Pulling a Fast one . I was Seeing that Guy Taking a little ride in the trunk of a Lincoln Continental. Like in Good Fella's .No cheesy moments, no extra complexity, no flashy sets, no crappy lines...... two of the best people telling us to smile and relax while they r doing what they r best at. This movie works because its simple without the flashy n shallow stuff we see these days. The concept is really nice, unlike the previous intern movies this is put in the best way with a refreshing breath by the writers. Shows how success brings about changes hard to comprehend and also how old life also need craving of new. Loved every last bit of it. Niro at its recent best. Hathaway moving as always. loved it & want more like it. PS: take a note directors.

atlasmb,"A Feel-Good Film ""The Intern"" is not a romance. It is a feel-good movie, and a very effective one.

Anne Hathaway stars as Jules, a young woman who runs a successful internet sales company that she started from scratch. That's a good start. Ms. Hathaway is beautiful, talented and extremely likable. Her character struggles with success on two fronts--in business she is very hands-on but she can't do everything herself, and in her personal life she can't find the time necessary to make her husband and daughter the priorities they should be. In short, she wants to ""have it all"", but she has compromised and come up short.

Robert DeNiro is Ben, the retired widower who becomes an intern at Jules' company, hoping to fill the hole in his life.

The story has plenty to say about inter-generational relations and about feminism. Hathaway and DeNiro--and the other characters in this film--play their parts with warmness. Unlike many other comedies, there is hardly a trace of snarkiness. The lessons learned have to do with being genuine, and searching for what you need in life.

Who said a comedy can't be life-affirming? ""The Intern"" is and it offers the bonus of gently guiding the viewer toward real issues that everyone deals with.", 6/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Hellmant,"Despite being somewhat routine, and clichéd, the movie works. 'THE INTERN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

Robert De Niro costars in yet another Hollywood comedy flick; this one was written and directed by Nancy Meyers. He plays a 70-year- old widower; who goes back to work for a Brooklyn e-commerce fashion business, as part of a senior intern program. Anne Hathaway also costars, as his new boss. The movie also features Anders Holm, Adam DeVine and Rene Russo; in supporting roles. Despite being somewhat routine, and clichéd, the movie works.

Ben Whittaker (De Niro) is a retired 70-year-old widower. He's became very lonely, and bored, in recent times. So he decides to apply for a senior citizen intern program, at a business in Brooklyn; called 'About the Fit'. He's assigned to work with the company's 'work obsessed' CEO, named Jules Ostin (Hathaway). Everyone that works with Ben, immediately takes a liking to him; except Jules, who he initially annoys. She quickly gets passed that though, and the two form an unlikely friendship.

The movie is sweet and funny. Both De Niro and Hathaway are good, and extremely likable, in their roles; and the supporting cast is all adequate. The film is a little cheesy, and definitely nothing special; but it is amusing, and somewhat emotionally involving. Meyers did a pretty good job with it.

Thanos_Alfie,"Nice story... ""The Intern"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a seventy-year-old man becoming an intern on an online fashion site. He discovers a new world for him but he is excited about it since he wanted a new challenge in his life because retirement was boring for him.

I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple and interesting plot that in combination with some good interpretations made by the cast made it even better. The direction which was made by Nancy Meyers was good and she did a great job on the way she presented her main characters and their back stories. The interpretations of Robert De Niro who played as Ben, Rene Russo who played as Fiona and Anne Hathaway who played as Jules were also very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Intern"" is a nice movie to spend your time with and I am sure that you will have a great time watching it.

cosmo_tiger,"The movie is entertaining and watchable but nothing amazing and I thought Somethings Gotta Give was better. ""Back in action. Thank God."" Ben (De Niro) is a retired widower who is bored with his life. When he finds a flyer looking for interns at an internet company he applies. When he is chosen is is very excited, but when he meets the owner, Jules (Hathaway) his excitement begins to waver. Ben has been around long enough though and slowly he helps Jules not only with her company, but her life as well. This is not a bad movie at all, but really nothing more than fluff. On the other hand, when you watch the preview you pretty much expect that. The movie is entertaining and watchable but nothing amazing and I thought Somethings Gotta Give was better. Overall, a movie that would be easy to watch over and over but De Niro has come a long way since Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. I give it a B.

abouhelier-r,"The Intern 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin.

The Intern is directed by Nancy Meyers, stars Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. If - like me - you've seen Something's Gonna Give, It's Complicated, What Women Want or The Holiday you probably know that they've earned more than one billion dollars worldwide. So the odds are good that you have - you'll undoubtedly have certain expectations for Nancy Meyers latest movie. And they will almost certainly be met. I love her movies. This film is not the cheesy melodramatic comedy type; but a far more smart and clever mature comedy. Robert De Niro is a genius. We all know he's a fantastic actor, one of the best of his generation. This man truly is an actor, the genuine one still alive. He's what guys should aspire to be when they're 70. He's classy, he's sharp, he's charming and optimistic. Important things here I really do love him in this movie. Plus, he's a good contrast with Hathaway's character.

Anne Hathaway performance has a really nice core as throughout the movie you understand why she is the way she is. She graduated to the role of corporate fashion dragon, she's even permitted - not sure everyone saw that - in a witty touch, to toss her jacket to Ben in the blase manner of Meryl Streep's Miranda Presley in The Devil Wears Prada. Moreover she gets to deliver a wince-worthy sermon to three of her twenty-something male employee bemoaning the decline of Masculinity and decorum in modern men. Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford (not to mention De Niro himself), by contrast, are held up as superior role model's of ""cool"". The Intern appears like a generation gap fable or 21st century outlook on age and gender. The central theme is really about the younger generation versus the older generation and the different ideology of both generations. How an old person approaches something and how a younger person does. The major message is taking a breath, relaxing, take time to retire from the hectic world and just take a minute to appreciate your surroundings. Finally, a Nancy Meyers productions isn't just a film; it's a cashmere jumper unto itself.

Overall, The Intern is a light hearted and fluffy movie. It's not groundbreaking but a really good time!", 6/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I watched soon many movies, my favorites are sci-fi mostly but this movie is gorgeous! It was very touching, heartwarming and you took some lessons from it literally!

De Niro... 'The perfect man'... He plays the gentleman perfectly like he plays the mafia in other movies... He is a legend and he shows it with this movie too.

Anne Hattaway... Simple, pure and talented.

You did a great job, i want this kind of synergy much much more. Thank you very much, you made our day excellent!

tabuno,"A Rather Unique Relational Movie 22 October 2015. Robert DeNiro and Ann Hathaway star in this dramatic comedy about an elderly intern to an e-business executive. Directed and written by Nancy Meyers, The Intern offers up an entertaining and finely balanced movie about growing older, about females balancing business and personal responsibilities at home, and about close relationships in general. It is an engaging look at contemporary life and the human element that we often take for granted. The Intern is hard to rate because it's much more reflective of life than the dramatic stylish script the audience and critics have often come to expect. Nancy has incorporated intense, sensitive dramatic scenes which derive from the natural human state of existence rather than the oftentimes overly dramatic scenes for audience reaction. The ending of this movie is a case in point, it doesn't end with explosive titillating satisfaction, but with a soft landing of the expected natural consequences of life trying to work itself out.

This movie resembles coming of age comedy-dramas like Uptown Girls (2003) or Waitress (2007) but for the elderly with somewhat older established women. There is also some suggestive elements that could even come from the Best Oscar classic Roman Holiday (1953) with its primary emphasis less on the romantic comedy than on the experience of everyday business life, such as Ann Hathaway experienced in own her breakout film The Devils Wears Prada (2006). What's remarkable is that The Intern reflects one of the few movies that doesn't focus on a romance plot and instead uses another relational theme as the movie's core and still is able to captivate and move the audience, a rare and difficult accomplishment in itself. Even so though, unlike Lost in Translation (2003) the ending doesn't seem to quite able to smooth out the uncomfortable mental ruffles.", 6/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Floated2,"Better than expected The Intern is a relatively small minded comedy drama starring Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway. This film ended turning into a success at the box office, while it was appropriately released at a proper time and had a lengthy stay. The Intern is good due to the cast of its lead and their chemistry throughout. Although predictable, it works well here and the film isn't as soapy or cheesy as one would have expected. Several subplots come into the film in the second half as it deserts itself from another plot, or there may be some plot twists that occur but these things keep the film entertaining and never boring. Overall, the Intern is a solid comedy if you are into these type of films.

capone666,"The Vidiot Reviews.... The Intern

Nowadays, most retirees have to return to the office in a janitorial position.

Thankfully, the widower in this comedy doesn't have any dependents living in his basement.

Feeling obsolete since retiring from his job, former phone book publisher Ben (Robert De Niro) returns to the workplace as a senior intern for an online fashion house.

Assigned to the site's workaholic founder Jules (Anne Hathaway), Ben quickly becomes an indispensable part of her life, thanks to his sage wisdom.

But his ethics are tested when he learns a secret about Jules' husband that could send her into a tailspin, and her website under.

In spite of its far-fetched premise, obvious plot points and sitcom- esque situations, this coming-of-old-age comedy is wryly writing and playfully acted by its charming leads, whose chemistry is awkwardly comforting.

Although you do have to constantly reassure senior staff that women are allowed to wear pants to work.

jack-davy,"Should Not Be Listed As 'Comedy' I was led to believe 'The Intern' was a comedy film. This is how the film was marketed, sold and listed. Sadly this is not the case.

It is a 'feel-good' film. It's not a soppy love story and nothing climactic or 'explosive' happens at all.

So yes, I was disappointed not to be rolling on the floor and wetting myself with laughter. But I was genuinely happy for the 2 hours to watch two different lives come together and form a great relationship.

I just wish that this was not listed under the 'Comedy' category. They should put it under a 'Feel-Good' category or a sub genre a la 'Light Hearted Drama'.

Anywho, 6 / 10 for me. Nice, happy, jolly film. Goes on a bit too long and nothing really happens but still... Happy happy happy :)", 7/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jtindahouse,"Charming but there's not a whole lot going on Some movies get green lit on the strength of their story and script, while others get green lit based on the star power they've managed to sign on. This is the latter and there's no problem with that. Some movies with certain actors in the lead role would be absolutely dreadful, whilst with other actors in the same roles could be absolutely brilliant. I new Robert De Niro was one of those actors and now I've had it confirmed for me that Anne Hatheway is as well.

De Niro recently starred in 'Dirty Grandpa' with Zac Efron and took a bit of flack over that, with people questioning whether his days of tremendous acting performances are over. While he may never have another role like he did in 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Taxi Driver' he can still act absolutely exquisitely. Hatheway I've never been sure over. She absolutely blew me away in 'The Dark Knight Rises' as Catwoman but in that case she was working with Christopher Nolan, arguably the finest film director working today. She had also not overly impressed me in a few things so I was a little undecided on her. In 'The Intern' she brings a charm and levelness to the character that throughly impressed me and confirms that she is a very fine actress and should be kept an eye on in the future.

The script doesn't have a lot going on but at the same time it never pretends it does. It knows it's not thought-provoking enough to win Academy Awards. It is content with giving a couple of great actors (along with a great cast of supporting actors) a couple of hours to charm an audience. It does what it sets out to do well.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

captainmike-michael,"Charismatic Chemistry Between De Niro and Hathaway Not to confuse with 2013 Fox's The Internship, this similar type of drama without a ship behind feels more promising, funny but not ridiculous and thoughtful which one could have expected through its poster. The story delivers something fresh, a creative idea of senior citizen internship program to present the cross-generation relationship, events that are commonly occur in daily working life and how important is the experience of the elderly to inspire the younger generation. The film moves in a smooth pace, filled with nice musics and inspiring scores, along with a gentle spirit that attracts audiences to spend time following the amusing characters for about 120 minutes but a little bit upset by the rushing second half and too unrealistic perfection on its ending. However, the warm, charming and charismatic chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is the sweetest and most beautiful part of the film to enjoy which makes us believe that we can manage well both career and family life.

He decides to challenge it. Then, his new life starts. His new work place is a company of apparel fashions. He is assigned to under direct to Jules, the CEO of company. At first, he doesn't have any knowledge, but he does hard what he can do. Gradually, people around him like him, also Jules gets to like and believe him because of his character. Also, Jules has a problem about family, so Ben becomes a good adviser. This movie can cheer people who work or do something hard. They can think to continue to do. I will watch this movie again if I lose my confidence. Also, you want a warm adviser like Ben. Ben is a good example of gentleman, so I hope men follow him.

Reno-Rangan,"A film that differentiates the young and old generation. I would definitely say it is the director's best film. I have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them. I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it. Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway.

You are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here.

This is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people.

So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part.

From the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world!

sol-,"Internal Prominently promoted with the tagline ""Experience never gets old"", this Nancy Meyers movie spins a familiar tale of an old man proving his worth (despite being technologically backwards) and impressing the younger folks around him. The basic story is quite predictable and all the anti-ageism messages are nothing new, however, the film has an undeniable charm to it and a surprising amount of energy. On occasion, the tale feels a little too sweet, such as how Robert De Niro's character becomes a mentor and father figure to all his colleagues so quickly, however, it is all the quirky comedy that stands out. A particularly amusing subplot has De Niro engineering what him and his colleagues describe as an 'Ocean's Eleven' style heist. Celia Weston additionally has a fun bit part as a spunky temporary chauffeur. Meyers also handles the inevitable romantic tension between the stars quite well. There is one scene where it looks like things are about to turn passionate between the pair, however, the situation is eventually diffused with De Niro's stares and body movements conveying his discomfort without any need to blatantly state it. In short, this is a far more agreeable film than might expect given the past credentials of its director and De Niro's uneven movie choices of late. This is probably his most solid performance since 'Silver Linings Playbook', cool cameo in 'American Hustle' aside.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Perfect ratio of drama, comedy and romance.

floguy-00231,"A movie whose time has come ... Although I'm a lover of the cinema I've never written an IMDb review. But after watching the trailers for this upcoming film I wouldn't miss it for all of the peaches in Georgia. As long as it lives up to the promises made in the trailer, it's going to be a slam-dunk, hum- dinger that was absolutely made for this time.

Imagine a bunch of aging baby boomers who keep asking themselves, ""What happened to the world I used to know?"" and then watch the back-and-forth between Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Mr. De Niro plays a retired businessman who quickly grows bored with his apres-career life so he dives back in as an intern for a young female CEO that is played by Ms. Hathaway. It's pregnant with possibilities ... hilarious as well as soul-stirring possibilities.

Holy cow. This so resonates. I'm fifty-eight, retired and trying to write my own memoirs but it feels as if someone's beat me to the punch. If the film doesn't deliver as I think it will I'll return and revise what I've said but for now it's on my DON'T MISS list. Suits rule, experience counts and grey hair is dad-gum attractive. Good luck to the creators of this film!

***10/19/2015*** Okay, I'm back. Saw the movie with the wife last weekend. I was ready on the gong and was prepared to take back whatever I said earlier. Soooooooooooo .......... I was right. It's one of the best movies either of us have ever seen. The humor, the cuteness, the chemistry between Ann Hathaway and Robert DeNiro made it a HUGE departure from today's cinema norm. It was also chock-full of morality and morals that anyone from any generation would do well to emulate. I'm fifty-eight: college educated, former military, retired business owner, and I still tuck my shirts and polish my leather shoes. But this isn't an old fogies' film. It juxtaposes the old, flip phone generation with the new iPhone generation in such a charming way that I can only say ... go see it. It's the picture I would have made if I'd chosen a career in film production instead of the business in which I spent over almost 30 years. I hope there's a sequel.", 7/10,"16 out of 34 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

stevendbeard,"Feel-Good Comedy Like They Used To Make I saw ""The Intern"", starring Robert De Niro-Grudge Match, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle; Anne Hathaway-The Dark Knight Rises, The Devil Wears Prada; Rene Russo-Nightcrawler, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle and Adam DeVine-Modern Family_tv, the Pitch Perfect movies.

This is a comedy about and for adults. It's not a romantic comedy, just a comedy. The main message here is that just because a person is old, they can still have purpose-there is an old saying about with age comes wisdom, and that point is proved here. It is written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who also directed It's Complicated, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give and What Women Want. Robert plays a 70 year old retiree who is a widower and is bored just sitting around the house. He decides to go back to work and finds a job at an online fashion site. Anne started the company about a year and a half earlier-it is a new company-and she is trying a new program of hiring senior citizens as interns. At first, Anne has doubts about the program but soon realizes that it was the best thing she could have done. Robert shows her that experience does come in handy. Rene plays a physical therapist that gives massages to employees and her and Robert get into a little massaging outside of work. Adam is a fellow intern that is not a senior citizen but does learn a few things from Robert, both about his job and his personal life. The movie is a feel-good movie that reminded me of the comedies from years ago. It's rated ""PG-13"" for some language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.", 8/10,"0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

TheFearmakers,"Cliche Yet Surprisingly Decent Being a Living Legend has its pros and cons. The pro is, well, you're a Living Legend. And that title, given his previous track record, epitomizes Robert DeNiro... But when starring in yet another mainstream popcorn comedy, it's like John Steinbeck writing a Harlequin Romance...

But wait... this time around, something isn't missing. The collecting-a-paycheck DeNiro is replaced with a man so utterly stiff and endearing (imagine what his ailing character scolded Robin Williams to be more like in AWAKENINGS), he works despite being obviously created to win over both the audience and his tech female boss Jules, played by Anne Hathaway, running an online clothing company with a daughter and a stay-at-home husband; the latter as useless as DeNiro's 70-year-old intern, Ben, is utterly reliable....

Despite DeNiro doing the same mugging expression with his chin, constantly, he and Hathaway have decent chemistry, moving the story along...

Yet the plot isn't the stress of possibly sharing her company with a more qualified C. E. O., or melodramatic problems after work... mere afterthoughts compared to what Ben can provide, with his old school charm and wisdom, to help her out of the fancy yet disheveled canvas she's painted herself into...

For those (like yours truly) who miss ""the old DeNiro"" (ie young DeNiro in classic films); while he's not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, he effectively plays a gentleman whose been around the block despite the tract being somewhat cliche and predictable...

Trivia/Connection: Two actresses from the sit-com ALICE make appearances: Linda Lavin as a scene-stealing, smitten neighbor and Celia Weston (who replaced Diane Ladd who replaced Polly Holliday) as a fellow co-worker: And that show was based on a motion picture directed by DeNiro's then-cinematic partner Martin Scorsese.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

leonblackwood,"Enjoyable and emotional in parts. 7/10 Review: I must be getting soppy in my old age, because I actually enjoyed this movie. I know that it's extremely corny and the storyline is predictable but I found the movie sweet and DeNiro was great as the perfect gentleman. After playing the bullied victim in the Devil Wears Praia, Anne Hathaway (Jules) has gone full circle, in this movie, by running her own company whilst trying to be a mother to her young girl, Paige and a wife to her husband, who is having an affair. I liked Robert DeNiro's character, Ben Whittaker because I always wondered how it must be for the elderly, who have lost there spouse, and stuck indoors with nothing to do. Although this isn't a true story, I loved his ""get up and go"" attitude and the fact that he was willing to do anything to keep busy. Its been a long time since I have seen a film were the young have respect for there elders, which is how I was brought up, so I have to commend the director for not playing on the age aspect to much. The chemistry between Hathaway and DeNiro was also great and the fact that he knew what to say at the right time, without offending anyone, made his character unique and extremely sweet. The whole cheating husband element of the film didn't go overboard and I liked the way that Ben handled the tricky situation. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and I'm not surprised that it made such a profit. Enjoyable!

Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, 66, who brought you the Parent Trap in 1998, the funny What Women Want, with Mel Gibson, Something's Gotta Give, with the great Jack Nicholson, the Holiday and It's Complicated, with Meryl Streep. Judging by her previous projects, she is obviously a master in the Rom-Com department and she has worked with some top actors, who put in great performances in her movies. She also makes original movies and introduces different elements so they're not a straight lace romantic comedies. Although this movie doesn't have any romance at all, the relationship between the two main characters is still quite emotional, even though they come from two completely different world's. Anyway, this is definitely worth a watch, just to see DeNiro in a different light and it's good to see that a 70 year old man can fit into today's world of technology and offer his lifetime experience to the youngsters.

Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $200million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Robert DeNiro, Anne Hathaway, Rene Russom Anders Holm, Zack Pearlman and Adam DeVine. 7/10", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I didn't know it was a Meyers movie when i started watching it but i would have eventually after suffering those poorly written dialogues, mostly at the end of the movie. */spoilers/* Precisely at the husband-wife scene right at the very end. You know: that totally unrealistic conversation between to people whose arc was a fuc#$%ing and total mess. But i liked the De Niro-Hathaway relationship. Wasn't not remotely close to save the movie though, but i liked it. So, that's it. What else could be said about the movie? Anyway, Sorry for the excess of words here but i have to fill ten lines of text in order for this review to be considered as one. May the force be with you all.", 6/10,"3 out of 7 found this helpful.

gwnightscream,"""Good Comedy-Drama!"" Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Anders Holm and Rene Russo star in this 2015 comedy-drama. This story takes place in Brooklyn, New York where we meet Ben (De Niro), a retired, mild-mannered, widower who wants to keep busy and he gets a job as an intern for online fashion company, ""About The Fit."" Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) plays Jules, the company's CEO and founder who struggles with work and tries to spend time with her husband, Matt (Holm) and their young daughter. At first, Jules is a bit uncomfortable with Ben, but soon bonds with him and he helps her with her priorities. Russo (Showtime) plays Fiona, a massage therapist who works and finds romance with Ben. De Niro and Hathaway are great in this and have good chemistry. I recommend this good comedy-drama.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

iquine,"Cute (Flash Review)

On the surface this appears to be a standard drama sprinkled with bits of humor. But it accedes basic assumptions by having an above average script, dialog and a couple twists and turns. There are even some very funny moments from some very strange looking and well-cast, side characters that help energize the story. The plot is about a fast- moving tech company that hires some senior interns; not seniors in college but old retired people. DeNiro's character may be slow with the tech knowledge but brings a wealth of life experience to the company and the young CEO who struggles to run a company and have time for her husband and child. Amusement swirls around that dynamic. The movie is well-paced, decently developed characters yet does have a few weak plot moments. But overall, it was very entertaining and light-hearted.", 3/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

diogomm-65386,"Great message, great story. I actually enjoyed the movie a lot.

It gives us a strong message to respect older people's wisdom and experience, and that it can be very helpful even in the today's tech world. The actors are absolutely brilliant, there's no one who could make Ben other than Mr. Robert De Niro, and Anne Hathaway plays a perfect Jules. The soundtrack is fine, the argument is brilliant and everything looks where it is supposed to be.

To me the only thing I felt was that those last scenes were a bit rushed and that they could explore those developments a bit longer. Other than that, amazing movie. One of those who can be an opinion changer about older people's part in modern societies.

jimbo-53-186511,"This film is much better than its rather silly premise will have you believe Bored with retirement 70 year old widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) applies to become a senior intern at a newly founded online fashion site. Founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) has her doubts about her new 'applicant' in the early stages and considers getting him transferred to another department. However, she soon starts to learn that Ben is not only a good worker, but that he's also an excellent 'life-coach' whom Jules finds invaluable both as an employee and as a friend as well.

The start of the film presents us with a 'fish out of water scenario.' Whittaker is a 70 year old man who isn't terribly familiar with modern gadgets and in how the modern world works in general (which sadly houses an element of truth the older you become). The 'fish out of water' stuff is amusing, but isn't really enough to base a film upon, but thankfully it doesn't just use this as a running theme in this film.

I think the thing that I liked the most about this film is that it felt more like a character study on Jules' behalf with Ben kind of being written around her character. She's presented as a hard-working, go-getting woman who basically lives and breathes business, but the film wisely presents her as a 'flawed' character; had she been some kind of superwoman with a wonderful husband and a dream lifestyle then it would have made the film feel shallow, artificial and not particularly believable. However, by showing cracks here and there it does perhaps highlight the highs and lows of wealth and success. The film for me was a minor triumph because I found Jules to be a strong believable character and found her easy to identify with. Ben, to me, felt like the piece that was missing in Jules' life; he's an old wise owl who probably doesn't know an Ipod from an Ipad, but he's lived and he's more often than not on hand to chip in advice from time to time and at times he does make Jules see things from an alternative perspective. Whilst I did appreciate the warm bond that developed between Jules and Ben and I found Ben to be endearing, kind and likable I didn't find his character quite as believable as Jules; he came across as being a bit too nice and a bit too good to be true and some scenes in the film that bring him closer to Jules seem a little contrived; such as looking out of the window and seeing her driver swigging some alcohol and driving past and seeing Jules' husband having an affair with another woman. Yes it's possible, but incredibly convenient.

There are other minor issues such as some of the rather annoying 'hipster dialogue' which felt a bit forced and unnatural. I could also have done without all of the ridiculous Apple Product Placement.

On balance this film gets a lot more right than wrong and although the premise does present us with a somewhat ridiculous scenario, at the same time the content of the story comprises of many believable elements. The bond that develops between Jules and Ben is quite heart-warming and even though much of it is predictable and elements of the story are a tad contrived it's a film that's very hard not to like.", 7/10,"0 out of 3 found this helpful.

DavidLindahl,"Female business power In The Intern, Robert De Niro plays an old, restless, retired widower who doesn't find his freedom from work particularly satisfying. He finds a flyer about a position as an intern on a company that sells clothes online. Anne Hathaway plays the young stressful boss ho reluctantly hires him. The Intern immediately feels a bit weird and corny, mostly because of an old man as an intern, but at the same time that's what makes it feel new and fresh. It also shows a positive attitude towards the seniors in our society who usually plays oddball supporting roles.

The story develops and we are introduced to Anne Hathaways family, who she never spends time with due to her job. We also gets to know her personality and the problems she faces at work. The interesting thing about The Intern is that we follow the story through the eyes of Robert De Niro's character as he sees it in the film. The film's weakness lies partly in its length but also in the fact that many problems doesn't add up in a satisfying end. With its two hours runtime, The Intern feels too long for its genre and format. It needs to be tighter. Also, despite its length I still doesn't feel like we are getting enough screen time on the important problems, like her family and her relationship to her husband.

The Intern is still an enjoyable film and like I said before, it deals with an interesting topic. Not just because of Robert De Niro's role as an old intern, but also Anne Hathaway's role as a successful woman and the problems she is forced to deal with because of it. It asks us important questions like can a woman have a career and still care for her family? All in all, a watchable film with something good going on, but it would have been slightly better with a little more post-production work. Still, it is enjoyable and I grade it 6 out of 10, because it was entertaining and it deals with a present problem in society.

Special-K88,"basic but pleasant Seventy-year-old, Brooklyn-based widower and retiree Ben Whittaker's life is an ongoing, relentless effort in creativity. Despite immersing himself in various activities (fitness, travel, languages, etc.) he has a void in his life that he's desperate to fill, until he signs up for a senior citizen program at an e-commerce fashion startup run by Jules Ostin, a prototypical workaholic who's initially skeptical about Ben's ability to contribute to the business. The biggest criticism of this easygoing, feel-good comedy-drama from Nancy Meyers is that it's a bit too simple, perhaps even a bit too congenial for its own good, but--much like the lead character--it gradually grows on you, has some genuinely funny scenes, insightful themes, and makes the most of the unorthodox but effective pairing of De Niro and Hathaway. **½

jimbori,"Amazing movie The Intern is a comedy film, released on 2015. Directed by Nancy Meyers.

The main characters of the film are the Academy Award winners Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, Silver Linings Playbook) and Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables, The Devil Wears Prada).

The film told us the story of Ben Whittaker (De Niro) a widower of 70 years old and a retired man, who wants to keep his life and mind busy, he travel, he learned new languages, he takes yoga classes, he goes for walks and tried his best to make a busy life, anyway he keeps feeling like something is missing in his life, like he could do more and be more. Until one day, he found an ad for Senior Internship Program at a fashion agency, he made a video to apply for the internship. The agency hires him and his position will be assistant to the young founder and director Jules Ostin (Hathaway).

The story keeps telling us how Ben develops at the work, how difficult is for him to adapt to a new age of young workers, how traditional he is but at the same time the energy he has and how much he wants to learn about everyone and help in anyway he can; the film also show us how free is Jules for work, how dedicated she is and passionate are for the agency that she created. The film show us how the relationship between Jules and Ben develops, how little by little they started to connect as friends, as co-workers .

It is an amazing film for me, the story has everything that a comedy should have, the music is amazing, the cast made an incredible work, the writers have created a beautiful story about a talented woman and how her life changed thanks to an incredible man who the agency gave the opportunity to make part of a work team, no matter the age. The film really keeps you exciting, it is very interesting, funny and all the film is awesome.

If you want to stay at home on a weekend and watch an amazing comedy, you definitely should see this film, because you can enjoy it and don't think about anything else. If you loved Anne Hathaway on The Devil Wears Padra, you will definitely love her on this film and De Niro makes a terrific work on this comedy, very different to all the kind of movies he has made, but you will be surprised of how good he is. Hope you liked as much as me.", 3/10,"3 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Almeisso,"Predictable I gave it a three because of Robert De Niro's quality performance. Otherwise this movie is a one or zero. The movie is grossly predictable. Seems that zero thought went into the writing. This movie may likely appeal more to women as my wife loved it and watched it twice. Too much crying in the movie. Too many clichés. My gut told me to skip this one but my wife implored me over and over to watch it. The movie is forgettable. The story line is not compelling, the characters lives are boring. De Niro brings humor and the just plain high quality acting you expect from him. His suits are nice as well in the movie. Anne Hathaway is, well Anne Hathaway. If you love her in other movies you'll love this. If you hate her in other movies you'll hate her even more after this movie. Oh, the little girl who plays Anne Hathaway's daughter in the movie is cute and genuinely funny.

smatysia,"Light entertainment. Nothing more This is a decent film if one does not have unrealistic expectations for it. It is, more than anything light entertainment. Nothing more. Acting from the leads was good, and, well, it should be, from Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Sets, costumes, photography all fine. No problems with the direction. Some previous commentators have taken issue with the various ""messages"" of the film. I thought it was just modern Hollywood fare, leaning left, of course, but not outrageously so. The criticism of Anders Holm's casting seems valid, as he was irritating, and makes one wonder what Jules ever saw in him. I liked Christina Scherer as the harried assistant. A small shout-out to Annie Funke and Wallis Currie-Wood in tiny roles.

deltaforce7,"Coulld have been funny and nice, but it is too synthetic When a bunch of good actors get together just to make a buck, this kind of flick happens. I understand that in today's job market some young people are no good at most jobs, because they lack experience, education, ethics and what not, while older people lack ... an ability to cooperate with managerial idiocy. So, no one is any good for a job anymore!

This movie demonstrates this job market situation clearly enough.

Anyway, everything is made in china, so what can be done, right?

At the same time, whoever made this into a comedy had no idea that a comedy has to be dynamic, it has to have some actual ""funny things"", funny moments that most viewers would understand (ya know), and it has to relate to the public who watches it. Not too many people know of any ""business-ethic-less"" start-ups that actually last, so very few individuals could possibly identify their business experience with this funny company. So this is neither associating nor funny. But MOST IMPORTANTLY, I do not know anyone who would act and speak so unnaturally, idiotically, uneducated-ly - you name it - as most characters in this flick do! Most of these characters do not seem to be able to form a spoken word without acting like mentally-challenged clowns. I mean, if some types act like this, it does not mean that the entire Brooklyn is a dumb circus or something. And what kills a viewer is the way how a highly experienced person who is in no need of extra income is forced to kiss up to some disorganized, mentally-problematic broad who somehow runs this great business! A seriously business-experienced person with no need for money could ever bear any of this unnatural, ridiculous, disorganized nonsense. I am sure, for real, that this movie had been made by people who never found themselves in any sort of a business environment. Furthermore, as it is true most of the time, these Hollywood types keep making movies about Brooklyn, but they do not know what it is like and who inhabits Brooklyn! Poor attempt of depicting your imagined Brooklyn! Hollywood, you are making fools of yourselves more and more.", 7/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

lord_ashour,"Started entertaining then it went bad The first half of the movie was fun to watch, then the movie became a massage about how there's no real men anymore. And then it became a massage of feminism and all men are cheaters and how a women should not care about anything but her own happiness.

The creator of this movie didn't know where to go with the original cute idea and in the end it was one big boring mess.

I did like the chemistry between Robert and Anne though. They make a fun duo.

Go watch something else if you value your time. I gave it a 4 because the first half of the movie is fun and the acting is solid for the main characters.

ShelbyTMItchell,"No Chick Flick or Romantic Movie but Cute Still It shows another side of the Intern. As they all come in different shapes, sizes, and what have you.

It is not a chick flick or a romantic movie. But it is a cute movie nonetheless.

Robert DeNiro is Ben as he is a widower and grandfather who does not seem to enjoy retirement. As he goes and applies to be a senior intern in the clothing industry despite not knowing anything about the high tech world.

But he wins people over and makes fast friends over his old school approach. The building where he works there is a twist you have to see.

There the boss Anne Hathaway, a working wife and mother whom is on the fast track to success. As she and DeNiro become friends, as he becomes a personal assistant and confidant.

Won't win any awards but still it is a cute movie!", 6/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

mariaeleni_pntz,"""The meaning of life is your career and your social ascension"" - not my kind of film. I can't say that I didn't like this film.I really like De Niro and Hathaway. But there was something about their characters and the values they promoted that I didn't like . As if everything in life revolves around work and success. De Niro's character had absolutely nothing to do with himself when retired (which indeed happens a lot in real life but this doesn't mean it's not sad). I mean do people get so alienated from themselves they have no idea who they are when they are not working? And they just can't stay in a room with themselves if they don't get some kind of social validation ? That is really sad. As for Hathaway's character, being so ""private"" and suspicious is almost insane. But the worst part was the heart to heart the two of them had near the end of the movie, where he tells her that her career is more important than everything else and if her husband can't cope it's time she let him go. Wow !!! I'm not saying cheating should be excused but the focus was not on her husband's cheating on her during this conversation. The focus was on her career and how that is the most important thing in a person's life and no one should be allowed to get in the way. This is why I say I didn't like the values promoted in this film. People reduced to financial and social achievement... not my cup of tee.", 7/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful.

rogerdarlington,"An appealing inter-generational movie American writer and director Nancy Myers, a woman in her mid 60s, has made her name with a particular type of movie, such as ""Something's Gotta Give"", ""The Holiday"" and ""It's Complicated"", and ""The Intern"" fits right into that mould: tales of love and loss told from the a perspective which is that of a woman or older person or both, essentially comedic but with some wry observations and some occasional poignancy. There are too few films aimed at a maturer audience and, as a sensitive man of a certain age, I enjoy her work, but she is careful never to be too challenging.

In this case, the female point of view is that of start up founder Jules (a delightful Anne Hathaway) who is struggling to have it all: a demanding job, a loving husband, and a delightful daughter (something's gotta give). The perspective of an older person comes from a man, the intern of the title, Ben (a charming Robert De Niro), who is widowed and lonely (fortunately the lovely Rene Russo is on hand as Fiona the company masseur). As well as her usual themes, Myers plays with some inter-generational issues especially around technology and work-life balance, in a work that is light but made by two eminently watchable leads (Jules has some great clothes and Ben is rarely out of a suit and tie).", 6/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was so excited as I am a big fan of Robert De Niro, and always try to see his movies in the theater on the first release day. De Niro 's performance was flawless as always, acting as a real gentleman creating very touching scenes. But the screenplay was not enough rich to make this movie worthwhile spending 121 minutes. They could not use De Niro 's humor properly in creating funny moments. The movie screenplay also had some weaknesses which i don't want to mention not to be a spoiler. I did not like it. Hope you enjoy it if you are determined to watch it any way.

tomsview,"The mentorship This film surprised me. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did.

70-year old Ben Whittaker played by Robert DeNiro, in a role that would give Morgan Freeman a run for his money as the oracle of wisdom, becomes an intern in a seniors' program at a successful e-commerce company run by Jules Ostin. Jules is played in a winning performance by Anne Hathaway – the sort that Meg Ryan used to revel in.

What I thought would be a movie where the comedy came from an old guy confronted by digital technology wasn't like that at all. It's funny and there are plenty of clever lines, but it's also a character study on a number of levels: what it's like to be retired and still feel the need to be needed; it's also a look at relationships when traditional gender roles are reversed in pursuing careers and raising families.

What Ben Whittacker brings to the table is confidence tempered with humility and restraint. He is old school in manners and dress, however he becomes a calming presence on the technology savvy and live-for-the-moment Gen-Z's that surround him.

Having been in exactly the same situation. I was mid-60's in a large office where the next eldest was under 40, and most under 30, and I wasn't the boss. Often what we have going for us are communication skills, a bit of hard-won experience, and possibly an old-fashioned ability to spell. As Ben Whittacker realises, although he isn't completely computer illiterate, he is surrounded by a generation of people who seemed to have had computer programs inserted at birth; he even has to ask his 9-year old grandson what a USB Connector is.

Jules Ostin has built a business from scratch and now employs 250 people, but it has entailed sacrifice; she is basically a very nice person whose success has far outstripped her readiness for it. She is hiding real vulnerabilities as Ben comes into her life and slowly fills the gap left by her parents who have an uninvolved attitude.

This is a gentle comedy that really sneaks up on you. It's warmer and funnier than Nancy Myers' ""It's complicated"". It's also very different from the ""The Internship"" starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan, which also dealt with the generation gap in a similar environment.

Although ""The Intern"" has something to say about women and power, it's not rammed home – all the points are gently massaged into the story.

This is a clever, beautifully made film that does not lose you for a moment.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

He is accepted and and becomes the assistant of the company's owner and director. Being a nice, wise and helpful man he soon is in everybody's good graces including his director being not only useful for her in business matters but also her personal and private advisor. They soon become friemds. The whole story is told smoothly making a very entertaining slight comedy.very pleasant to follow.

Sure..it was crafted to be simplistic..a feel good movie..fine. But why waste such great actors on mediocre material ? perhaps Meyers originally did have some worthwhile scenes that were discarded in editing....Oh well..that's today's Hollywood..worthwhile meaty scripts are as rare as a 2$ bill -how's that for a fitting cliché'? Wait-..here's an alternative storyline...she hires the CEO-they fall in love after a few weeks, then-- DiNero and his new GF become close with Ann and new BF-they get smashed-and stoned one dinner date evening and do an ""intimate open forum..that's four-um !!"" Dinero is declared the winner by 2 knockouts and at work they now call him ..yep..THE RAGING BULL !!!

Matt_Layden,"Lighthearted fluff. While watching this film my wife commented how depressing it was. DeNiro is a widower, living a lonely and routine elderly life. He claims to be happy, he just needs to fill that time with something productive. He spots an ad for an internship for the elderly and gets the job. The job is at a cutting edge fashion upstart, run by the determined Anne Hathaway. She started this business on her own and it's now massively successful, which takes a toll on her family and her sanity. To make matters worse, the investors want a seasoned CEO to run the company, much to her disdain. Can this new intern help relieve some of this stress?

To say I was surprised at this film is an understatement. I went in thinking I would hate it, but I was delighted. The film is cute and has heart, much of this is due to the performance from DeNiro. A man known for playing foul mouthed tough guys, plays a heartwarming old man trying to be relevant again. He had a job printing phone books for a living, talk about feeling outdated. Now he has to learn how to use a USB drive, something his nine year old nephew helps him with. Hathaway has a decent role opposite DeNiro, the hardworking woman who has no time for her husband, or her child, despite her attempts to make room for both. The film is very pro 'working woman' and mentions this numerous times.

As delightful as the film is, there is no real conflict. Sure she needs to find a new CEO, but that doesn't really play to the centre of the film. No conflict, no tension of any kind. Things just sort of always work out for DeNiro, he's a jack-of-all-trades type of character. Need something done? He can do it. This goes to absurd levels when they literally break into someone's home to delete an email. A very out of place scene.

The film poses a few questions about man versus woman in the workplace, adultery and relevance. A weaker third act and an even weaker ending hurts an otherwise good film. The chemistry between Hathawary and DeNiro is good delightful and I'm actually glad to see him in a role that he seems to care about this days.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The_Film_Cricket,"Pancakes . . . The Intern is like a stack of pancakes. It's warm, sweet and leaves you with a touch of a belly ache. You are, no doubt, drawn in by the casting and who could resist a movie that brings together Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway? They're the best actors of their respective generations, but – WOW! – you keep wishing that they could find each other in a better movie. The Intern isn't bad exactly; it's light, breezy but is of no real significance.

De Niro, who seems to have retired from the hard-boiled, challenging roles that made him famous, plays a good-hearted retired widower named Ben Whittaker. Retired from a now defunct company that made phone books, he now spends his days trying to figure out how to spend his days. His wife of 42 years is dead and he needs a challenge. So, he answers an ad for an outreach program for senior interns (senior as in age) to help out at 'About to Fit', a successful internet company that specializes in women's clothing.

Ben gets the unenviable task of being the intern to the company's CEO, a supposedly tough-as-nails career woman named Jules Ostin (Hathaway). She claims she doesn't need him, but Romantic Comedy Law demands that she discover how much she really does need him, not just in the office but in her personal life as well. He becomes her driver (Driving Miss Hathaway?) and eventually he becomes her confidant. The two build a nice friendship that, it's a relief to report, doesn't bloom into a May-December.

The problem is, that's about it. The movie is as bland and superfluous as it gets. Director Nancy Meyer sets up the inner-office environment with the reverie of shop-worn sitcom. It's pleasant and nice but it's only established so that Ben's old-school experience can teach the young a thing or two, but none of it has any significant payoff. The people around the office are young whipper-snappers whose function in the film is to be young whipper-snappers and they don't matter either. They aren't developed as characters, they're just onlookers to Ben's successes. Ben develops a half-written and pointless semi-sorta-romance with the company's on-site masseuse (Rene Russo) which goes nowhere and ALSO doesn't seem to matter.

The plot developments are pointless too. Are we surprised to find that Jules' home life is burdened by the fact that her husband Matt gave up his career plans to be a stay-at-home dad? Nearly all of Jules and Matt's scenes are dedicated to talking about the fact that they never see each other. Hmmm.

For about the first hour of The Intern I was fairly bored. I liked Jules and Ben but I wanted the movie to clear out the junky plot points and just let them talk, let them be human beings who connected with each other. To that point, the movie had no real dramatic tensions . . . then it happens. A dramatic situation develops that actually seems to give the movie some dramatic weight. Not to give anything away, but Ben discovers something about Matt that troubles him. When he brings it to Jules, the two have a heartfelt conversation that seems to be drawn from the characters, not from the screenplay. Unfortunately, the results of that dramatic event are crushed by a resolution that nobody – but nobody – is going be happy with.

The Intern was written and directed by Nancy Meyers who specializes in cupcake-sweet confections like It's Complicated and Something's Got to Give and the Father of the Bride movies. Her films seem to have a consistent pattern. They contain a germ of human interest wrapped up in a gimmicky script that is fit for a bad television sitcom. The exception is a great comedy she made 30 years ago called Irreconcilable Differences, about a kid who divorces her squabbling parents. That movie had truth and human interest. The Intern has only faint echos of humanity. It has moments here and there when it shows the promise of what it might have been. It's a nice, sweet, uncomplicated movie that will begin disappearing from your mind before you get out of the theater and will have left you completely by the time you get to the car.", 9/10,"0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Worth watching just for the home break-in scene DeNiro is a 70 years old widower who becomes (along with three other 20-somethings) an intern at a trendy online clothing retailer in Brooklyn, and Hathaway is his 20-something boss, obsessed with putting her career ahead of her family. 

Entire cast did well, and there were a few funny moments scattered throughout, but it seemed like a lot of the humour was toned down for some reason, and the film never really comes alive, remaining mostly subtle and muted throughout (except during a hilarious burglary scene). Even affair subplot seemed watered down and lukewarm. A lot of product placement too (Starbucks, Skype, etc) became distracting and annoying.

bankofmarquis,"In a word...charming Like most of you, I did not make it to the movie theaters in September, 2015 to catch the Nancy Meyers ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy THE INTERN about a 70-ish man (Robert DeNiro) who goes to work at an Internet Start-up company headed by a a driven Millennial (Anne Hathaway). It seemed that this film was just going to be another Robert DeNiro phone-it-in ""paycheck"" comedy and not worth our time.

Boy, was I wrong.

In a word, I would call this film...charming. Hathaway is charming, the other workers and Interns at the start-up are charming and DeNiro (believe it or not) is the most charming of all.

Starring as Ben - a widower who is just withering away with inactivity and boredom who decides to go back to work - DeNiro shows he ""still has it"". His Ben is a strong character, as nuanced as one can be in this type of film and...yes...EXTREMELY charming. DeNiro most definitely is NOT phoning this one in - he gives it a very good effort (maybe not A+, but...) and it shows. He is on screen for almost every scene and holds our attention throughout.

Proving to be a worthy partner in this film is Anne Hathaway's driven Internet sensation, Jules. She spars with DeNiro throughout and the two make a fun pairing.

Also joining in on the fun is Rene Russo as a masseuse (and love interest for DeNiro and Andrew Rannels as Jules' ass't. But it is the trio of Adam Devine, Zack Pearlman and Jason Orley that almost steals this film as 3 knuckleheads that work with - and are mentored by - DeNiro's Yoda-like Intern. I almost would have preferred to see a film about these 4.

Nothing in this film is revolutionary or new and Director/Writer Meyers keeps it that way. It's like pulling on an old, comfortable sweater or a really well worn-in pair of shoes. It won't win any awards, but it is fun..and, yes...charming just the same.

THE INTERN is now streaming on NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME, if you are looking for a...I'll say it one more time...charming...way to spend an evening - look no further than here.

Letter Grade: B+

7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

junkedupmail,"Heartwarming, genuine and well executed All in all, I thought the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro was some of the best I've seen in a long long time. I kept forgetting that I was actually watching a movie. I didn't want it to end because I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters. I don't understand why some reviewers said there was no character growth. Please read below to find out why I think there was.

This movie touched and transported me. For example, the scene where Jules and Ben are on the airplane laughing and having a good time together had me smiling without even realizing it. I forgot that I was watching a movie and I felt more like I was watching two people I cared about. Also, the hotel room seen the two of them had me weeping. Who wouldn't want somebody to take care of them, feel genuine pride and concern for them, and offer them such a touching gesture which I won't mention because it could be considered a spoiler. But, watch for it. You can't help but be touched by it.

I look forward to watching this film ever since I saw the trailers in the movie theater. I could tell that it looked heartfelt and well written. I expected it to be kind of a gag about the old guy trying to adapt to new ways. It was so much more than that! It was a character study and the characters I felt were three dimensional despite what other reviewers have said. Other reviewers have said that there was no character growth. I completely disagree. Ben's character grew through the opportunity he was afforded by becoming the intern. I don't think he expected to experience everything that he did by taking that position. SPOILER ALERT: He did it just to ease his boredom but he got the opportunity to nurture and mentor his seemingly cold boss as well as find love again. Jules grew because through her relationship with Ben, things that she was feeling but had not admitted to herself became clear. So, I definitely think there was growth for these characters.

There are only three criticisms I have of the movie. One, the scene in which Ben first meets his love interest at work is a little juvenile in my opinion. I think the only purpose it serves was to illustrate that Ben could relate to his younger counterparts regarding a universal topic. However, I felt the part where the camera focused onto the object of the scene could have been eliminated and more implied than direct. We got the point of how he was feeling when she massaged him. We didn't need the extra graphic reminder of what was happening. I also thought the scene where the younger interns and Ben went to the mother's house seemed out of character for Ben. It was a pretty funny scene but it seemed inconsistent with who he was. I forgave it because it was funny. The third criticism is that I did not like the husband. We didn't really get to know him and somehow I found him extremely annoying. Maybe it was his looks or the actor who was cast in that role but I just didn't care about him at all.

A beautiful, touching, well-done movie that you will not be disappointed in.", 1/10,"13 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

justinktobin,"A refreshing dramedy I viewed Nancy Meyers' The Intern last year. I enjoyed it very much. It had some comical lines, visuals, and it is always a delight to watch the talent of the gorgeous Anne Hathaway. The story is unpredictable, the acting believable, and the characters likable. Moreover, my moral thirst was quenched when hearing certain parts of the dialogue. I will elaborate on this thirst quenching.

A widower and retiree named Ben (Robert De Niro) applies to be a senior intern at an online fashion business. Rather than sending in the conventional resumé, he is asked to upload a video of himself arguing his competencies. Ben is wearing the conventional suit and tie in the video, and is clean shaven. This is his appearance throughout the film. Ben lands the position, and ends up working directly with the female owner, the hurried, entrepreneurial Jules (Hathaway).

Like Ben's age of 70, his appearance is in stark contrast the rest of the men at the business, who are in their 20s and 30s, and donning hoodies, thick-rimmed glasses and facial scruff. Ben also has a more masculine demeanour than those of the millennial generation.

Jules' stay-at-home-dad husband, Matt, looks the part of the hipster sub culture, is soft-spoken, but very competent and busy as a parent. His fatherly role is an admirable quality, but at the end of the day, he is too tired to have sex with his bread- winning wife. (I would never be too tired for an intimate act with a woman that looks like Anne Hathaway) Matt used to be the bread winner, earning more money than his wife, but he stopped working so he could look after their daughter, and because he believes in his wife's ambitions and the future of her business.

One day at work, Ben is staring out the window of what used to be his old office, before the business space was renovated and became Jules' production floor. He notices Jules' driver swigging liquor from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag. Ben goes outside to calmly let the driver know what he knows, and offers to take over as Jules' driver. The man says he doesn't know what Ben is talking about, but eventually acquiesces, telling Jules that he doesn't feel good. This is admirable, and not to be confused the the silly white knight chivalry that permeates every facet of harmless situations. In this case, driving drunk is dangerous, so Ben's cool and clam, assertive expression of concern is genuine.

One day while Ben is driving Jules and Matt's daughter around, he notices Matt entering a vehicle and kissing another woman. When Jules finds out, she is saddened, hoping that Matt's affairs were over. She forgives him, they talk it through and reconcile, and she agrees to have a CEO run her business for her so that she can be home more. Later, Matt shows up at Jules' work and tells her not to make the step of getting a CEO because of her worry of infidelity on his part. He steadfastly argues that his infidelity is over, and that Jules should make her decision with her gut instinct.

The infidelity situation with Matt was thirst quenching to see, given the rise of women arguing that they cheat on their husbands because they feel neglected by their workaholic spouse. This is a situation where the traditional roles are reversed, with the man at home, and the woman at work. Now we know why Matt was too tired for sex. (I still wouldn't be too tired for sex with Anne Hathaway) I'm interested in what modern feminists think of this situation.

Ben's comments about putting on a proper shirt and tucking garments in are refreshing too. He's a masculine man, and he argues that one should dress to impress. His comment about Matt being a 21st Century husband was comical, but also very true.

There's a scene in The Intern where a the business's masseuse is giving Ben a foot rub that is very comical. A character walks in on this act, and we are shown the scene from his point of view, which looks as if the masseuse is...

In The Intern, we see the beneficial dynamic that a masculine man and a feminine woman of different generations can bring to business. Ben's traditional dress, chivalry, and masculinity brings something to the table, so to speak, and Jules shows Ben some the benefits of modern technology. One of the best comedies, dramas of the year. Good job, Nancy Meyers.", 9/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jim_flowers,"A chick flick with DeNiro = A good film OK, OK, sounds sexist, but the formula was chick flick (female makes good, makes you feel good). Add in Robert DeNiro and you have a horse of a different color, or maybe I've been married too long.

Really, this was a very good movie with and excellent cast. Anne Hathaway plays a good hard charging founder of an internet clothing line (About the Fit ) that does what everyone hopes their clothes will do when they receive, after ordering sight unseen, off the internet, ""FIT"". She cares deeply about her company, maybe too deeply, as we find out.

Hathaway has a family (a daughter and husband) that seem to play second fiddle to the company. The husband is feeling so far left out of the marriage he is having an affair. She just needs to learn balance and have someone she can count on helping her with the company, enter the intern.

DeNiro, the senior intern (as in age, & experience), is perceptive, too perceptive for Hathaway, and picks up on the familiar situation. His understanding, though, goes a long way to help the overall situation. Deniro, Hathaway, and all of the other cast have an excellent chemistry and rapport.

I don't want you to think that I think DeNiro carried the film, but, the film was called ""The Intern"". That being said, DeNiro brought his whole experience to the table, but Hathaway played her part with heart playing the fast moving, fast talking, fast at everything founder of the company with aplomb, much like her character.

I found the movie very refreshing, entertaining, and heartfelt. See this movie, you'll enjoy it! A 7 is what a consider a good movie, 8, 9, 10s are reserved for GREAT sci-fi and action flix, after all, I'm a guy.", 7/10,"3 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

miesnekawalki,"Lighthearted fun with unnecessary subplots First part of the movie has a really nice concept for a plot. We have this retired phone book factory worker who has too much free time and he decides to become an intern in some company to feel useful again and fill the gap in his life after losing a wife.

The concept is great and it works! The movie is really fun and lighthearted, Robert De Niro has really nice chemistry with Anne Hathaway (and don't worry, there's no cheesy love story here, it's strictly boss - employee relationship which later on turns on into true friendship). Cinematography is really nice and everything looks like a perfect comedy with a nice message...

That is until we meet Jules (Anne Hathaway's) husband. From that point onwards the movie changes its tone a bit. It becomes more of a family drama than a comedy with the message. And then we find out that the guy is cheating on her...

What do you think that strong, resourceful woman do about this? She forgives him eventually of course, because what would comedy do without a happy end. But is it a happy end? This sends really wrong message to young people (for women - you should forgive adultery if the guy comes to you and swears that it's over. For men - you can stick your flesh missile in every female in your line of sight, your girlfriend will forgive you anyway).

I also don't really like that all of the people seem to be rushing in everything that they do. They talk fast, express emotions fast, and they show the sad truth of careerism (that girl working for 14 hours every day, imagine how wonderful her life must be).

All in all, this is a really good heart-warming movie, with one or two unnecessary plots packed together.", 7/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

BJG-Reviews,"CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10) The stage curtains open ...

Wanting to find purpose in his life again, retiree Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) applies for a senior intern position with an aggressive and ""happening"" fashion company. As fate would have it, he becomes the intern of the company's founder and executor, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Although she is skeptical and aloof at first, Ben's old fashioned ways and honesty win her over during a crucial time in her life, both professionally and personally. These polar opposites soon find out that true friendship can come from the least likely sources. And that a handkerchief, when offered at a tender moment, can mean all the difference in the world.

I absolutely love this movie. It is down to earth, realistic and has a lot of heart. Anne Hathaway just seems to get better and better with each movie, and she is in top form here. She was endearing in her role and convincing. Robert De Niro is ... (well, what can you say?), Robert De Niro. Always good. The chemistry between he and Hathaway was spot on. Completely believable and entertaining. Rene Russo was also very good in her supportive role as Ben's love interest, Fiona.

This is one of those few movies where everything just clicks into place and works on all levels. It has its share of dilemmas and deals with them straight on ... nothing is slighted or made light of. All relationships were treated as important, as they should be - even the cute side story between another intern and Jule's secretary. It showed how anyone, no matter what their age or status, can have an important impact on our lives. How we should take notice and appreciate them for what they do and who they are.

I highly recommend this movie. It has become a fast favorite and I will be watching it again.", 7/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

georgios-christodoulou,"Robert and Anne at their best. I just got back from the cinema theater. It's past midnight. I feel so moved and inspired by this film that instead of going to bed I felt like writing something about it. I went to watch ""The Intern"" with some reluctance, I admit. Anne was the decisive factor! Sorry Mr. De Niro but she is gorgeous and cute at the same time.

Still They say that actors, lawyers and doctors never retire. The older they become the better they perform. Robert De Niro proved that. If not the best, one of the best acts of his life. So expressive, so emotional, so everything! The combination of the ages, the development of the story, the whole concept of the movie were excellent. Loved it. I haven't seen better of Anne Hathaway since ""The Devil wears Prada"". The couple, the whole cast, matched perfectly.

Fully recommended for all ages. I give it 10 without thinking twice.

rzajac,"Genuinely a ""Chick Flick"" in the worst sense of that expression ""The Intern"" is an exemplar of the concept of the ""chick flick"". It's a term I've never really liked. I remember, back in the day, figuring that when folks talked about this, they meant a flick that lacked narrative integrity, or played it morally safe: Think of a room full of pillows: No matter where you fall, you'll probably be OK. And, if the writers and producers strew enough pillows around, they can release a ""safe"" movie where life might seem to deliver the usual slings and arrows, but it's all kind of bundled up, cozy and warm, and no one actually has to really suffer. No real rules are broken, no one comes up against a real heartache, everyone gets to be a hero, the mistakes made are cautiously hedged, the antagonists are dogs with rubber teeth, and the whole enterprise is swathed in a comforting blanket of by-the-yard innocuous teasing-the-ears-of-absolutely-no-one sonic wallpaper background music.

The Intern is this kind of flick. Everything about it is totally careful. The filmmaker doesn't want anyone to leave the theater feeling even a bit bruised, even while it's supposedly weaving a tale of interpersonal relationships in The Big City, where in reality the baggage of life perennially breaks down the wagon of love.

Now: All that said, the flick has some saving graces. It's always great to see acting professionals take direction very, very well and deliver the goods; and they do here. Some of the humor is _genuinely_ heart-warming. I have to say it _is_ a sort relief to sometimes sit and watch a non-stop stream of happy, unflappable faces, on at-worst nominally neurotic characters, flit across a screen for a while.

But, in the end, The Intern is ""safe"" viewing fare, and at-worst an apologetic for the long-debunked myth of the Happy, Self-Respecting Intern. Interns (and Temps, and... and... and...) are largely being ripped off: Don't forget that as you watch the flick.

{{{side observation:}}} Someone posted a vid on YouTube entitled something like ""Tarantino cites 'The Intern' as one of his favorite movies from 2015""... and it's an obvious plant by a cybergrunt working for the production company. The keywords for the vid were set up to cleverly trigger Facebook's ""related items"" search, and FB postings related to this flick, or Tarantino, or H8ful Eight might cause this to pop up in your FB stream. It's at least as dishonest as ad clickthru GIFs that look like system dialogs. Even in light of Tarantino's admission that he watches Kate Hudson flicks on flights, I think it's safe to say that he'd... well, not exactly *despise* The Intern, but would certainly see it as not having enough of a redemption payload to redeem the time spent watching something so contrary to the time-honored film narrative esthetics that molded his own career.", 7/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

fee_rn,"Has the power to make you happier! Great movie The Intern was one of the best comedy/romance movies I've ever watched. This movie makes you wonder why it doesn't last much more, that's how I felt when it got to the end. It's touching, it's simple, warming, colorful. Anne Hathway always stunning and amazing at what she does, more and more movies I watch with her more I like her (and I'm a fan, haha). De Niro couldn't be more CUTE! He's superb in every single way, and his character in the movie, aaaah so cute! I like to rate a movie for how it made me feel in the end, and this movie made me feel so good from the moment it started... I was very excited to watch it because of the amazing review score (specially for comedy movies, which ar never too high) and I'm so glad I did! Guys watch The Intern, it's the perfect family movie.

IronBallsM,"A nice -- feel good film This really is the definition of a ""nice"" movie. When the performances and the concept are this good, sometimes nice is more than enough. Everything plays out in a rather formulaic way and the resolution involving the marriage issue felt hallow. Yet, Deniro and Hathaway's characters were charming enough to make up for any shallowness. I really did love the old school versus new age philosophy on display and wish they had featured way more of that in the overall story. Seeing his skills pay off more instead of him just being a good guy would have been more rewarding and given the film more depth.

In the end, heart wins out over the clichés and the movie turned out to be a ""nice"" way to spend two hours.", 5/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

vegannow,"Corporate America needs free Labour This movie strongly promotes the meme of working for free as an intern (unpaid Labour).

I cannot imagine that the older generation will willingly volunteer for menial tasks for no reward especially when they can actually help people rather than just sell crap for somebody else, so I can only imagine that this is just an end run at persuading millennials that working for free is ultimately worth it, because, you know, corporations cannot afford to employ you, or otherwise your parents are rich enough to support you while you ""buy"" an advantage over poorer people who cannot afford to give up their Labour for free! It's interesting to see all the elitist assumptions that are propagated during the film, such as it's okay to take a seat in the back when it's your driver but when it's your intern you should make a pretense of sitting in the front! This film is worth watching provided you 1. Don't pay for it, and 2. Can view it cynically, and use it as a lesson in avoiding both corporatism and elitism.

Still as the intern job in the film is related marketing ""fashion wear"" it should be no surprise that his position is unpaid given Labour abuses in this field are the norm.

Still it's nice to give work to popular actors who need money, as opposed to young unload actors, while doling out trite, feel-good, fake-nice, trash. Sarc.

I have to wonder why this film is so popular given all I've said, but then the reviewers probably aren't the same people working in the garment industry or working unpaid internships, maybe the theme of the film is that America is a very class *unconscious* society where the poor can be ignored, or maybe there is no moral and the writers are simply elitist!", 8/10,"9 out of 17 found this helpful.

mickman91-1,"A rare Hollywood flick that is really lovely and enjoyable, but without being cliche and predictable How often do lovely uplifting films come round that are not about romantic relationships? This film does a wonderful job at looking at the beauty of a supportive relationship between an elderly man and a young woman. It is a straight up Hollywood movie done in a conventional style but without relying on all the predictable tropes that make you roll your eyes. It works so well probably because the script is great, the characters are 3D and human, and they are brought to life with honest portrayals from Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro.

mailes22,"Excellent acting. Sweet story. Thoroughly enjoyable movie about the value older members of society can bring to the workplace as well as the perennial issues of successful working women juggling work and family life. Yes, we're 'still having to talk about it'.

The weaknesses of the movie are the saccharine sweet family scenes between Anne Hathaway's character, her husband and daughter (the kid was an excessively beautiful child and was clearly acting with the sole direction ""be sweet""). The overall effect was just too much. The other big weakness was the ending. It leaves the viewer thinking ""so, what happened?"" The solution to the problem was glaringly obvious from the moment Robert DeNiro's character walks into the office on his first day, the movie seems to be heading in that direction, then he inexplicably plays hookie for the day, and ... nothing other than ""just breathe"".

Good movie. Very enjoyable. Well acted. Just ran out of ideas for a decent resolution at the end.", 8/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

sufyaanrashid95,"A Charming and Heartfelt Tale of Unexpected Connection's ""The Intern,"" directed by Nancy Meyers, is a heartwarming comedy-drama that tells the story of an unconventional friendship between a retired widower and a young, ambitious entrepreneur. With its endearing characters, genuine humor, and insightful exploration of intergenerational relationships, the film offers a delightful and uplifting cinematic experience.

The movie follows Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower who, feeling unfulfilled in his retirement, decides to apply for a senior internship program at an online fashion retailer called About the Fit. Despite the skepticism of the company's founder and CEO, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), Ben's wisdom, experience, and genuine desire to contribute make him an invaluable asset to the team.

As Ben settles into his role as an intern, he forms an unlikely bond with Jules, who is juggling the demands of her successful business and her personal life. Ben becomes Jules' confidante, offering guidance, support, and a unique perspective rooted in his own life experiences. Through their interactions, both characters undergo personal growth, challenging their preconceived notions and discovering newfound strength and fulfillment.

""The Intern"" captivates audiences with its well-rounded and relatable characters. Robert De Niro delivers a standout performance as Ben, capturing the essence of a man who is both wise and vulnerable. His portrayal is nuanced, showcasing his comedic timing and ability to convey deep emotions with subtlety. Anne Hathaway shines as Jules, portraying a complex and dynamic character, balancing vulnerability with strength and determination.

The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is palpable, elevating the film's emotional depth. Their friendship is beautifully developed, rooted in mutual respect and a genuine desire to help each other grow. The natural and heartfelt interactions between the characters create a sense of authenticity, making their connection all the more impactful.

Nancy Meyers' direction shines in ""The Intern,"" as she masterfully blends humor and heartfelt moments. The screenplay delves into themes of work-life balance, gender dynamics in the workplace, and the value of mentorship. The narrative explores the challenges faced by both Ben and Jules, offering insights into the struggles and triumphs of different stages of life. The film strikes a delicate balance between lighthearted comedy and poignant drama, resulting in a rich and emotionally satisfying experience.

The production design and cinematography in ""The Intern"" contribute to its overall charm. The vibrant and stylish setting of the fashion company juxtaposed with Ben's classic sensibilities creates a visually appealing contrast. The attention to detail in the costume design further enhances the characters' personalities and adds depth to the story.

""The Intern"" also benefits from its strong supporting cast, including Rene Russo as the company's in-house masseuse and love interest to Ben, and Adam DeVine as a young employee who forms an unexpected friendship with Ben. Their performances add layers of humor and warmth to the film, complementing the central relationship between Ben and Jules.

While ""The Intern"" is largely a feel-good film, it does touch upon deeper themes such as ageism, gender inequality, and the challenges faced by working mothers. These issues are handled with sensitivity and serve to enhance the narrative, making the film more relatable and thought-provoking.

In conclusion, ""The Intern"" is a charming and heartfelt film that celebrates the power.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

CineMuseFilms,"Clichéd plot line that annoyingly produces a thoroughly enjoyable film. Surely they are not still making films like this. Do today's audiences really want pre-feminist stories about wise old men that step in to prop up gorgeous and successful young career women whose feminine foibles are not only career-limiting but funny too? Casting the wonderful Anne Hathaway alongside the venerable Robert De Niro is the only way a director can get away with such a vacuous and demeaning narrative, and annoyingly produce such a thoroughly enjoyable film.

This charming tale rests on an age and gender inversion where a bored 70 year-old former top- rung executive applies for an internship in a fast-growing online fashion company, a narrative with playful echoes of The Devil Wears Prada (2006). De Niro gets the gig, but only because of company policy against age discrimination; when he is assigned to assist CEO Hathaway some beautiful chemistry emerges that crosses age boundaries.

There are many charming, funny, and touching moments as the unflappable ""senior intern"" settles into the chaotic youth-driven business space. If you are not amused by such ageist insights, much of the movie will be lost on you. The creatively brilliant CEO who admits to ""not being good with old people"" is disorganised and at risk of losing everything unless she acquires some strategic skills, which of course women don't have and men are loaded with. The old versus new culture clash is one long cliché expressed through baby-boomer work-ethic mini sermons offering fixes for the hipster's free-for-all work-styles. Its all mixed together with his cute efforts to learn Facebook, her adorably feminine bouts of self-doubt, her stay-at-home husband doing wife work, and other random themes that don't cohere sufficiently to elevate the film's achievements. But most De Niro and Hathaway fans are unlikely to be bothered by the clichés of this ""behind every successful woman is a wise man"" fable and find it an entertainingly likable film.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

harthtrah,"Simple adn fun Very fun and quiet movie to watch, very relaxing and brings great messages. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway obviously enhance the film with their incredible acting. Ben Wittaker, a 70-year-old widower and is tired of the everyday life of retirement, and, seeing a job offer for senior interns on a fashion website, decides to accept it. The company run by Jules Ostin, an empowered woman who managed to create a large successful company on her own who, in just 18 months already has more than 200 employees, is tasked with hiring a CEO to help the company, even if the company has already founded it alone and don't need anyone's help, we continue to see as a ""young woman"" successful businesswoman very linked to the technological and modern world and a man well alienated from this they manage to communicate and create a great bond of friendship. Fantastic film to see as a family or alone to clear your head.

corazontvc,"What movies used to be A thoroughly enjoyable night at the movies is what you will witness. Hard to believe that the actor who played the semi-psychotic Travis Bickle in 'Taxi Driver' is the same one who plays a wizened intern here. DeNiro shows his talents in what he doesn't do, he plays a 'less is more' type of nuance to his character and it works.

This movie also speaks to generations. Whether right or wrong, the movie seems to be siding on the superiority of generations past. People of a 'certain age' as the film divulges, are of little practical use. We are exposed to the minutia of humiliation as people repeatedly ask if they can hear them or remember what they've just said, because of course they're old. As the film goes on, perhaps the ways of old were not complete nonsense after all. There is a solidity to all of the people on screen which ultimately comes down to people who no one will ever know of. The details got taken care of so the actors could just act. Not much to do with the movie I guess, but I know what these anons do.

Giacomo_De_Bello,"7/10 Does it stray far away from a by the numbers mid-budget dromedy? No. Does it bring original and inventive filmaking and style to the table? No. Does it look like I've seen before some of the scenes and even seen countless parodies of them? Yes. Good now that we have that clear I can open up and tell you how delightful and heartfelt this film is.

And I will start by saying what I thought as soon as I started liking the film, which was the same as what I thought throughout and what I think is what makes the movie win: it is simplistic, but it dam well knows it is and has fun with it. There are just so many movies that try to be insightful, original or serious and end up shoving down your throat a version of facts that is pathetic to itself and its tone. Yet ""The Intern"" makes it perfectly clear from frame one that it know it is simplistic and by doing so you go along with it so much more happily and end up having the good time the movie deserves. Moreover being simplistic doesn't exclude the fact that you can be reflective, dramatic or interesting, obviously not to ""American Beauty"" levels, but in a pleasant and welcoming yet not to deep way.

It is so fantastic to see Robert De Niro actually commit to a performance 110% and his commitment truly delivers. This is in my opinion a great performance, he adds so much to his character and manages to make him totally believable and present on screen. You really forget it's De Niro. Hathaway isn't any less committed and whilst she isn't as good as her co-star she most definitely has her moments and contributes to the chemistry they have together. On a side note this film is also shot remarkably well for the locations and situations it offers itself to shoot.

Peronally I always felt the movie to be hear felt. It has characters that it treats with respect and interest, it subverts some way too common genre clichés and ultimately offers laughs and drama genuinely for the most part and I was delighted to be carried away and have fun, other than take the occasion to lightly reflect on the more serious aspects of the film.

Now as much as it avoids some clichés it does fall into just a couple of gigantic ones that really undermine a part of the movie and take away some the joy from it. There are useless but fun characters and there is a very standard and unremarkable style that often lessens the importance of many events that still manage to resonate because of good writing and characters, but don't really leave a print on you.

I had fun and I would gladly recommend the film if you want to have a very light watch at the theater and not feel stupid or insulted by some of the other crap we are often served in this genre.", 6/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

DanLawson146,"A feel good film done well POSITIVES:

1) Robert DeNiro is fantastic. He is so warm and endearing and this really shows the range of his acting ability 2) The film had me engaged throughout. I was smiling throughout most of the film and then when the emotional moments came I felt them too 3) The character relationships between DeNiro and everyone at About The Fit really do warm the heart. His relationship with Hathaway really is a friendship of equals, but then he also adopts the father figure role to the rest of the interns and seeing them start to dress like him etc was a great touch

NEGATIVES:

1) The score sometimes ventures away from 'feel good' and becomes a bit too 'cooky' for me 2) If I was being really strict, the film could have been more streamlined without the romantic elements. DeNiro's romance and Hathaway's romance ultimately wouldn't affect the film that much if they were taken out 3) A pet hate of mine is when films have driving scenes in which there is a blatant CGI background and the characters are blatantly not actually driving a car", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the scene of Ben admonishing Matt, That was amazing because he did that without mentioning his affair.

I've also learnt that how to express our feelings and thoughts is really important from the scene that Matt visited her office to apologize for affair.

The point is whether we can impress them or not.

The jokes and fun parts were on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic, immersive and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by amazing costuming and cinematography.

The entire cast had very strong chemistry between them, and both Hathaway and De Niro were wonderful.

jb_campo,"Fun uplifting cross-generational film As a 60 year old guy, I related very well to The Intern. Robert Deniro stars a Ben, a 70 year old widower who wants a job to add something dependable to his life. Ben worked for a telephone book company for 40 years, and he misses that regular rhythm of life. He's got everything organized and set, except he's run out of things to spend his time on.

Enter Jules (Anne Hathaway) as the CEO of a startup clothing company. Her focused disregard to details of her life are startling, but she's so focused on making her company successful that she's unable to pay much attention to the details. In short, she's burning out because she's in a bit too much over her head.

She finally starts noticing Ben, who gets hired as an intern to connect with older folks, and Ben has a lot to offer because of his strong experience. Ben can relate to everyone, young, middle, older aged folks. He's your prototypical nice guy. It gets hilarious to see some of his interactions with his colleagues, and how he starts having everyone's back because he so has his stuff together.

Can he find fulfillment? Can he find new love? Can he save Jules from herself? Go see the movie to discover if all this is possible.

My only complaint is casting in the form of Jules' husband. They chose Andres Holm, whom I never heard of. His looks didn't match what I would imagine a match for Hathaway as. His acting was not strong enough, nor believable enough. Otherwise, very strong performances from the other stars.

The Intern should leave you smiling and hopeful. I hope you enjoy this film.", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

FallenEye,"ATF is Ready to Explode. Ben may have told Jules that she had something many people don't, that is big beautiful and exciting, and though he is right, what he has however, is something way bigger and far more satisfying; Ben had a full life, and that, is something even less people will ever get to experience.

The Intern isn't perfect; some parts of it were abandoned without conclusions and nicely tied bows, while others were a bit out of balance with the message this film was trying to bring across, but ultimately at its heart, The Intern beats strong enough to incite warm and stirring emotion.

This film is funny, it's fun, it's interesting and the chemistry between its stars were well worth the watch. Anne and Robert were great and Nancy Meyers is really proving herself to be quite a fascinating story teller of love, life and its complications.

The main characters were pleasantly presented and well handled, while the core of the story still managed to shine through, and not only is that important, but it also demonstrates talent. Again, The Intern isn't perfect, but it is solid. 7.1/10.", 5/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

thindi31,"One of the best of 2015 I was expecting a good movie. It is DeNiro after all! But I did not expect to be as entertained and delighted as I was. It was cleverly written, dialogue that was perfect for the setting and the ages of the stars. The movie told a real story and didn't sensationalize by violence, sex or foul language. As a newly retired person I was definitely able to relate but the story of the young folks starting out in their careers is something other age groups in the audience can relate to. It was poignant at times. I laughed. I cried. I cheered, well inside my head. The outstanding performance of the newcomer, little Paige, shows us we will be seeing much more of her. She is adorable as a movie child should be but really talented. What a little treasure. There is much about relationship in this movie..between workers, lovers, friends, with yourself. They were real people and someone each viewer can relate to. Be ready to belly laugh, weep a little, cheer for a favorite character, chuckle and be glad you saw it! I highly recommend it.

How it gets such a high rating makes me very suspicious of IMDb. The movie is weak, a very poor story line after the first 30 mins. Also a massive amount of advertising, a cynic would conclude the money involved in this movie 'helps' with the rating. The husband is the movie is very poorly cast, and Rene Russo it totally wasted in a cameo role. The only reason this doesn't get a 1 star is down to De Niro and Hathaway. I'm not sure they need to be doing this sort of film, are times that hard? This could have been so much better. It's not.", 8/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The best bits are the Interns interactions with his co- workers. It might give you a semi pleasant distraction for a while if you don't really think about it.

sbwords,"What is De Niro doing in this movie? The Intern - A Movie Review.

Robert De Niro's place in the Parthenon of great movie stars would be secure if his career played in reverse; starting with 'The Intern' moving through 'Meet the Parents', 'Analyze That', 'Heat', 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'Taxi Driver', 'Godfather II' and 'Mean Streets' to name but a few of his roles. Unfortunately, we can't reverse time, so now face the threat of his place being lost by an appearance in 'The Intern'.

I'm not going to bother with a spoiler alert, because the plot of this film is so predictable you could see everything that was coming; nice soft-spoken retired widowed guy works for nasty dot-com business bitch-lady, who has cheating mister mum house-husband and beautiful daughter. He helps save the business, gives everyone advice on relationships, hooks up with the firms hot, but mature, in-house masseuse, whilst introducing all the nerdy geek guys around him to the benefits of carrying a handkerchief.

Now, don't get me wrong. De Niro acts well and is engaging in the role. There is even a small homage to 'Taxi Driver' as he repeatedly practices eye-blinking in front of a mirror ""You looking at me"" style. However, what is the man who manifested Travis Bickle, gave us a young Vito Corleone and channeled Jimmy Conway, doing in this formulaic fluff of a movie. I was prepared to forgive him for 'Meet the Parents' because it was mildly funny, although 'Meet the Fockers' stretched that forgiveness to near breaking point. With 'The Intern' I can only assume he needs the money or is fulfilling some hidden contractual obligation. Either way we can only hope for a return to more gritty roles, although his next release entitled 'Dirty Grandpa' suggests otherwise.", 7/10,"2 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

feae-72598,"The Intern The Intern is nice movie I've ever seen. This movie tells that working is full of enjoyment. The title of this movie says 'Experiences never get old'. I think this words push people who feel difficulty or anxiety with job. 70 years old man helps his boss many times, but he doesn't show off his talent. Although it is different from real world, its position like him gives hope for young worker. And this film show that difficulties of living with partner or family comfortably. For men, women should work in house harder than at office. I can read the fact by watching The Intern. This film has many aspects about life for example, work, marriage and raising baby. I recommend The Inten for people who does not start working.

jmoneyjohal,"A classy mature, feel good film, full of laughs and heart warming moments. D'Niro and Hathaway have amazing chemistry. Being a gentleman, having true class, women empowerment, how life doesn't end after a certain age and how to deal with real life relationships are all things a film like The Intern deals with. The Intern is the definition of feel good cinema, I can guarantee you that throughout the film you will be smiling, and there so many instances the film is just so heart touching.But what really works for the film is the lead cast of Robert D'Niro who is only getting better with age, and Anne Hathaway who is epitome of really beauty. There chemistry is just perfect.

Story wise the film talks about a 70 year old man named Ben, he is officially retired, and is a widower. After traveling the globe for awhile, he is back home and hates thinking about living at home all day,so he keeps himself busy all the time, sometimes he goes to visit his kids, or goes to starbucks etc. Until one day he learns of a opportunity to become a senior Intern at a online fashion company, and he pounces at the opportunity. He eventually gets the job, and meets the owner of the company Jules. Jules is a young but busy women running a company by herself, and she has a family which her stay at home husband runs. How the not so tech savy senior intern Ben comes into Jules's life and helps her in her journey is what the film is about.

Acting wise, I must say Robert D'Niro steals the show, his character is so well written, and he embodies the traits of being a classy gentleman wonderfully. Anne Hathaway looks so beautiful, but more importantly gives a superb,mature act.The rest of supporting cast has done a great job, and is casted perfectly.

The Intern is a movie made for a mature audience, and while the film has many laughs, the films undertone meanings are what really win your heart. I truly loved how the film dealt with the message of women empowerment in such a fresh but beautiful way. And one of the films major assets was how the character of Robert D'Niro was written, how even after being 70 he is still enjoying his life to the fullest, and how he is a true gentleman. I mean for me the film really didn't have any negatives other than the place slackened a bit towards the end

Overall The Intern is not a pathbreaking film, but the film truly lived up to its amazing trailer.Its nice to see a film deal with real life situations, in a beautiful, light manner and not be so serious and sad. Its a film I throughly enjoyed without any hiccups, and its a film I highly recommend, you get your tickets worth in just seeing the chemistry between D'Niro and Hathaway.

Will make people who want that I want to be in love feeling and the I want that life Hathaway has will certainly like the movie.

Truth is life is mean and more like a Rocky Balboa movie where you get knocked down by life itself but you have to get back up and fight to get any recognition in the world.

5 minutes in and I forced myself to watch the rest of the movie. Painful and predictable. Good luck to those who rated it higher than 2. As it seems to be a rip off of the Devil wears Prada with a lot less aggression.

Suitably funny and boasting notes of capable melancholy, the film easily entertains even if its charms are not long-lasting. The Intern is light-weight and enjoyable. With its well-placed leads, handsome aesthetic, and charming sense of self, the film easily appeals. It may not necessarily stand-out, but The Intern makes for a pleasing experience.

He plays the gentleman we should see much more often in life.

And my praises go to Anne Hathaway as well, she practically shone in the movie. Her presence made the whole screen glow, I'm star-struck. Her portrays of the character of a successful businesswoman with her struggles (without overdoing it) in balancing family and work issues is so believable, it's just so natural and real and many can connect with.

Zaffy-1,"in a galaxy far far away... In a galaxy far far away... a.k.a. the Intern's universe, everyone is a kind, caring, lovely, wise, good willing, hard working, great person, moral compass, with a permanent smile on his/her face.

Don't get me wrong, I like movies that show the bright side of life and are positive and all, but even in fairy tales there are some dark moments or some kind of villains.

But this movie is flatlined! Everyone is a sweetheart and apparently New Work is a great - sunny - clean city full only with happy pleasant people.

Among them, standouts De Niro's Ben, who is not only a spotless person but apparently some kind of a super hero who at the age of 70 can work long hours, be there for everyone, keep solving all kind of crises while keeping clean and tied up a lovely home and have a relationship with Rene Russo.

Half of the movie, I was honestly expecting the dark secret to be revealed. Ben is an alcoholic? a gambler? he had a dark past? he has some naughty vices? something ? anything? nope.. nope nope... He is just perfect!

I am by nature very optimist and I believe than every person can be a good one, I have been even accused as laughing to much. But even for someone like me, this movie really tested my joy/happiness/utopia limits.

In conclusion, if you want to have a getaway into a world where people apparently only die from happiness and joy, you will love this movie.", 6/10,"1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

silmarieni,"A very good film I enjoyed every minute of this well made and very well acted film. The script, while not earth-shattering in originality and surprise, is tight and solid, with a little additional je ne sais quoi here and there. De Niro delivers a nuanced and wonderful performance, as is Anne Hathaway. He is very believable as an ex top-executive that is very modest and helpful no matter the chore. You feel he has much more to offer to anyone willing to ask for business advices. Hathaway in the same way, I found absolutely believable both as a super-woman-high-energy-startup-founder-and-ceo, and at the same time fragile and at risk of being crushed. She is so charming and so classy. She does not strike me as one of Hollywood's top beauty, but she sure sparks on the big screen and must be a dream for fashion designers, as everything she wears looks outstanding.

The film also benefits from superb supporting actresses/actors such as Rene Russo.

In short, I would recommend this film to anybody wanting to enjoy a good, intelligent story, free of car chases and explosions, but full of nuanced and great performances.", 8/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

brandnewme-35054,"Loved this movie! First of all, I am a huge Anne Hathaway fan. That said, I loved this movie! The juxtaposition of Robert De Nero with Anne Hathaway is charming as well as surprising. De Nero's character could have been a patronizing know-it-all after 40 years in business but he wasn't. Hathaway's character could have been a patronizing tech-savvy bitch, but she wasn't. Instead, this unlikely duo made things work. My only quibble with the movie was that the main problem of overloaded micromanaging Jules was not fixed, only calmed by Ben's presence. She still is not having a family life, not having enough hours in the day to do all she wants to do. The good-feeling ending was not a solution, only a smiley face band-aid.

santiagocosme,"As long as there' s De Niro... De Niro really is special. He has deservedly been labeled one of the true greats in cinema history. Of course a movie like ""The intern"" does not do justice to such an amazing actor, but still, it's enough to show that when he wants, ha can also play a role that would considered easy and make it look dead easy.

The movie is not memorable by any means, but it's perfect for a Sunday afternoon. In fact, the reason I am typing this review is because I did not find another similar movie to watch.Yes, there are hundreds of comedies released every year, but very few are catchy enough to get your attention. Maybe, it was the name of the movie that did it, for me, I'll just say this: please give De Niro more movies to act on.

bt698nhj,"Strong 7 I'm very close to the prestigious 8 on this one.

De Niro was outstanding. The movie moved us in uniquely 2015-era ways: old-school businessman endorses young working woman's career and becomes her confidant both personally and professionally; working woman deals with stay-at-home dad's infidelity. And older widower finds meaning and potential love in retirement and singleness.

The movie clearly tugs at our heartstrings and we willingly go along. The theme music was taken from a dozen similar movies, but gave it a vintage feel and served the movie well. The last 2 minutes were odd. It's hard to end a book or a movie well.

About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating).", 2/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I read the first few reviews of the ""loved it"" sect and then went to the ""hated it"" section...The Hate it section was hilarious! Watching them come up with analogies, which were not as cliché as the movie, thus destroying most of their points was stimulating!

Those that loved it, I can see why...It's a nice safe story and filled with decent people...Nothing untoward...

On to the movie...

I give a 5 because it had some heart but...Just enough heart to give you that ""meh"" feeling. It seemed miscast for some reason...The daughter too precocious, the business woman too driven; the husband (blech, what a nudge!) Bobby, consummate pro, although his face always seems to be frozen in that ""You talking to me?"" grimace...This would make a great TV series on like; TBS. They could flesh it out some more...

Motion-Picture-Watchmen,"I just know there's a hole in my life and I need to fill it. This film is obviously not a flawless, riveting masterpiece. But sometimes, movies should be straightforward, light-hearted and sympathetic without having deeper, mature themes.

Subjectively, I simply adored the basic premise of a widower filling the void in his life and showing the new generation of the old one how to do things. Add to that that the movie is set in New York, which I always appreciate.

Robert De Niro is brilliant as a thoroughly likable and gentle intern.

I liked it. It was a pleasant surprise.

On a more trivial note, how unconventional is it that Quentin Tarantino named this movie one of his favorites of the year it came out?

urema-1,"Read the synopsis and you'll have seen the film I was hoping for something more risky, but what I got is a paint-by-numbers feel good comedy. It tried to have more carnal humour (happy ending massage part etc.) but they fell short as it was not in tone with the rest of the film. If you read the synopsis of the film, you pretty much get the gist of what is to come. Generation v generation jokes and dilemmas, stereotyping all old people as useless etc.

Nothing special or new - just a feel good film where both protagonists learn and grow.

The issue I had with it the most was that everyone was so understanding and picture perfect. Perfect speech. Perfect responses to crises in their lives (you know, when your husband is having an affair this is an opportunity for you to be level-headed and learn something about yourself). Perfect clothes. Perfect teeth. Etc., etc. A bit too polished everywhere.

Tonnes of product placements - helps with boosting that profit margin.

In my mind it could have been way shorter, and thus more effective, more punchy.

There were moments that it was touching or well acted etc., but overall it was nothing special. The tone felt like a TV movie you'd see on Sundays' at your grandmothers, somehow backed with a big budget.

Nothing much to see here, unless you want to run it on in the background whilst making Sunday dinner.", 5/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

chappywatched,"Chappy Watched: The Intern I hadn't really heard much about this film or really seen any trailers but there wasn't a lot on to choose from so we thought we'd try this.

How bad can it be? It Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway!

It's not bad at all! This film was a complete surprise and even made it's way into my Top 10 for 2015!

It's well written with the laughs and the drama flowing beautifully together as well as seeing the generational differences between the two leads.

Speaking of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway; they are brilliant together as well as with the rest of the awesome supporting cast members.

There's plenty of drama, romance, laughs and just plain entertainment to be had with this film.

But

I'm not a fan of the ending, it feels like maybe there wasn't a clear idea on how to end it and it felt rushed.

A great film to watch, even if you don't happen to be a fan of any of the cast or even have any idea of what the film is about.

heatherworkmanrios,"Cliché and boring I wasn't a fan. Fell asleep multiple times. Lots of clichés, bad child actor (sorry, but im just being honest). The husband portrays all the stereotypes of a stay at home mom/wife which just made me cringe. Doesn't acknowledge the misogyny that causes these stereotypes to happen.

Robert Dinero is great but the character's quirks are tiring after about 10 minutes.

ForTheMostPart1999,"A heartwarming-style comedy drama A man finds his true passion after his retirement from a phonebook printing company despite his passed-away wife included. Finding out how stressful his female boss can get, he does what he can do to stabilize her, with his older age thus his longer life experience. While there was certainly a least an average amount of laughter, I would consider this more of a drama (a nice one in fact). There was certainly a lot of hype during the e-mail crisis scene, thus making the film more interesting and almost forcing people to pay attention to it again if ever the problem. It's basically a satisfying relaxing comedy with a catching plot. Fairly decent overall.

AnishMisra,"The Intern Review The Intern is a film written and directed by Nancy Meyers. I had just heard about the film being a good one. I saw no trailers so I didn't know what to expect out of it. After the film finished, I was satisfied. It's basically a slice of life kind of film.

Plot: Ben Whittaker, a 70 year old, joins as an intern to Jules Ostin in an online fashion company.

Story and Direction: The story is quite simple. We have a man, old and alone, having to do nothing basically, joining as an intern to just make himself busy. Now that's something an old man always faces which is very beautifully shown here. Then we have a contrasting character like Jules, who is very busy and doesn't have the time for almost anything (today's working women). Both of these characters are balanced quite nicely. We also have certain characters of the office which are quite enjoyable. Also we get a sneak peek into Jules' home where she has a husband and daughter, for who she feels she is giving less time due to her job. The most of the story is perfect. I had issues with some things. Like Fiona the massage therapist. Although the character was very little, but still, trying to make Ben and Fiona a pair was kind of making the story go off track. Another thing was the office people helping Jules in one scene of a mistake made by her. I mean, don't we say we should keep our personal and professional lives separate.

Performances: Robert De Niro is a great actor and its always a joy to see him. Anne Hathaway was also good as the working woman Jules. Rene Russo as the therapist was also good in her small role. Adam DeVine as Jason was good in his comic portions. Zack Perlman and Jason Owley were good too as Ben's colleagues. Anders Holm had a sincerity in his role.

Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Jules helps Ben open up a Facebook account. And Ben in turn tells Jules about his work. This was basically where I felt the essence of the film lied. The older and newer generation sitting and talking and sharing ideas.

Verdict: I had a great time with The Intern. It was a good film. Robert and Anne were great in their roles. Although a few missteps, but the film is still watchable.

I am giving it an 8/10.", 8/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

lyninbyron,"De Niro Sold the Story! Robert De Niro was so likeable and wise in this movie, it made me go awhhhhh!

I've seen loads of De Niro interviews and his face says it all. I don't want to be here, I don't want to answer your questions, when will this interview be over , etc, etc. Watching so called STARS be interviewed begrudgingly, is starting to really grate on me. If you want to peddle a movie, stick your game face on for a while, you get paid enough! If you are tired of giving interviews, then we're just as tired of listening to your uninteresting, stilted, painful, one word, boring answers. Better still, don't go to the interviews, no one wins De Nero.

michelletalkstv,"Started off entertaining but got boring fast I didn't expect much from this movie, and I guess I got what I expected. The synopsis seemed somewhat interesting and original so I was willing to give it a shot And for the first 30 minutes or so I will admit I was engaged and interested in how the story would develop. Robert Deniro's character was highly endearing and I would have been more than happy to watch an entire movie focused entirely on him and his story. Deniro delivers as usual as I truly believed him in the role and rooted for him throughout.

Unfortunately most of Anne Hathaway's scenes felt forced and her story - although intriguing at points - was not entertaining enough to keep me interested. Although the two leads worked well together, the story was not enthralling, adventurous, or even comedic. By the halfway point of the movie I was ready for it to be over.

Caleb_Everett,"Better than what I expected. Hathaway is in great form in The Intern. She really is believable as CEO Jules Ostin and really excels in the role. Nancy Meyers really excels at these rom-com movies that make you feel like the characters are believable and the storyline (even no matter how absurd) might actually be believable.

Aside from Hathaway, De Niro is a breath of fresh air as a 70-year-old widower who is just trying to figure out life as a retiree. The only negative that I could grasp from this movie is the fact that all the younger people took a page from De Niro's ""experience"" and started molding towards his way of life, but he never reciprocated that behavior. I guess having him sign up for Facebook?

As a Workaholics fan, I really enjoyed seeing Anders in a more serious role and he really performed it quite well. Well until he had to cry that is.

brg-06015,"uplifting show, funny, showed a seniors choice to move on with his life The movie was funny, meaningful and a wonderful change to the blood, guts and gore which seems to be very prevalent in most of the movies today.

It was a movie which does touch home to a lot of our citizens being seniors today. It was a pleasure to watch and bring along my grandson, which I must admit he thought was a good show as well. We both laughed a lot, understood the predicament of the senior and how he captured the admiration of the youth.

We left the movie with a smile on our faces and felt that it was time well spent.

japamo,"An ""Intern"" in Life and Love Throughout history, I imagine many members of the human race have been gerontophobic (i.e. afraid of old people or of getting old). The movies often have a similar attitude. In them, usually, elderly or older people are anachronistic, out-of-it, narrow-minded conservative fuddy-duddies that need exposure to today's young whippersnappers to discover fulfillment and purpose. I thought the movie ""The Intern"" (hereafter ""Intern"") would fall into that condescending mold.

""Intern"" stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old former executive at a now- defunct (of course!) telephone book manufacturing company who is getting a teensy bit weary of retirement. He decides to re-enter the workforce, but what 21st century company would take a chance on a ""geezer"" like him? It so happens that his old friend Patty (Linda Lavin) has a flyer from a fashion-clothing, wholly Internet-based business called ""About the Fit"" seeking participants in a ""senior internship"" program. Ben goes for it but learns he must submit a ""video resume"" as part of the interview process, which naturally sounds bizarre to his traditional ears. However, he submits a recording and is selected as an intern.

Ironically, ""About the Fit""'s offices are located in the same brick warehouse building that Ben used to be CEO. But now the space is filled with laptops and smartphones and young casually-dressed salespeople coordinating orders and deliveries. Can ""old-fashioned"" Ben, whose most technologically advanced gizmo is a tiny Samsung phone, get ""with it"" and carve out a niche in this growing company?

""Intern""'s ""surprise"" answer is ""Of course he can"". Despite a few expected faltering starts in using the new equipment and getting along with much younger co-workers like frantic lives- with-his-parents geek Davis (Zach Pearlman), tech-savvy Jason (Adam De Vine), and polite Cameron (Andrew Rannells), Ben's experience and professional, wise demeanor soon gain their trust and respect and help him advance. Still, at least at first, he can't seem to connect with About the Fit's founder and CEO Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Put simply, she's the latest word in workaholics and is so anxious to expand About the Fit nationally, she rides a bicycle throughout the vast building to most efficiently keep tabs on her workers and make meetings she insanely schedules so close together. Jules was not even on board with the ""senior internship"" program (did she even approve it? She can't remember.) and really doesn't want to deal with Ben (nothing personal) and even tries to get him re-located to another department.

Still, Ben's work ethic and commitment make an impression on Jules as he becomes not only a reliable, valuable work consultant, but also fatherly ""life"" consultant. This is where ""Intern""'s title becomes (obviously) ironic. Ben is really not an ""intern"". He's already led a full life and has his priorities straight. Jules is the true ""intern"", but in life and love. Her business has grown exponentially, but at the expense of her stay-at-home husband Matt and former engineer (Anders Holm) and her spunkily-cute, precocious young daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner). Both Paige and Matt crave attention that Jules has no time to give, and Matt may be, shall we say, looking elsewhere to get it. Furthermore, Jules's critical, overbearing mother (always off-screen) keeps sending her snarky e-mails. The demands of work and family are causing unbelievable stress and Jules is even thinking of ceding business control to someone else. Can Ben point her in the right direction?

""Intern"" is a gentle, calm, rather emotional, but life-affirming generational movie that re- assures us that older peoples' experience and wisdom never go out of style and, if presented non-judgmentally, can help younger people make informed choices on how to live a happy, balanced life. I liked De Niro's and Hathaway's tentative but adult, mutually respectful interactions and their discussions about her professional and personal future. I also liked the sprinklings of belly-laugh comedy as well, mostly involving company masseuse Fiona (Rene Russo) giving Ben an arousing massage, and a hilarious attempt by Ben, Davis, Jason, and Cameron to break into Jules's mother's home to retrieve her laptop and erase a really nasty e-mail Jules sent to her.

Yet, for 52-year-old me, I especially appreciated ""Intern""s high regard for older people as personified by movie legend Robert De Niro. With his business accouterments, natty suit and tie (and ever-present handkerchief), and his quiet, rational confidence, he was a class act. We are all interns in life and love at one time or another, and it was gratifying to see Ben use what he learned from his ""life internship"" to help Jules deal with her own.", 5/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

theemuhammede,"He is not obsolete This movie was a great story about challenges that a baby boomer may face in the work environment at a newly obtained position.

Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, is a 70 year old widower who is trying to get back into the present world. So he receives an opportunity for a senior intern position at an online fashion site. Whittaker was doubted at first, but his charm, intelligence, experience and wisdom quickly gained him the likes and trust of his coworkers. His boss Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway, recognized Whittaker's work and slowly began to become attracted to him. So their work relationship slowly turned to something more.

There was some humor to this movie, but there was not much. It was a great story though that flowed smoothly.

Macleanie,"Uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated The Intern is evidence that movies can comedies can be uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated without crude humour and corny moments. Strong leads from both De Niro and Hathaway together with other very solid and likeable characters meant that this was a very enjoyable movie. The story is grown up and simple. The laughs are gentle and subtle but it leaves you feeling happy. Its a formula which has been tested before at silly humour level but this story is very realistic and bright. A thoroughly excellent comedy which was totally unexpected.

andredejongh,"There probably was an original script changed at the last minute First of all let me say that I l o v e Nance Meyers movies. They're mostly fun, romantic and have some good energy, with good quality actors. This time we had the quality actors but the movie turned out to be a bit bland. It became more of a Disney movie.

With the script as it is, some more edgy humour is needed. And for this Anne Hathaway clearly is being miscast. She is acting well but I don't see her bringing in some humour with the quality from the likes of a, like we had in the past, Goldie Hawn or, not unknown to Nancy Meyers, Diane Keaton. But they are both too old to play Hathaway's character. A Tina Fey jumps to mind: perhaps she would have been a better choice, although she is also already too old to play a young and upcoming businesswoman. Then perhaps Lena Dunham would have been the best actress to play this part, but then Robert De Niro would most probably not have been right opposite Dunham.

So with the script as we know it now, with some fun, little bit hysterical humour, the character of Jules Ostin would have had some more emotion and depth. She would have been more fun for us viewers to engage with and more interesting to watch. Now she was too emotionally childlike and too nice for a woman who moved mountains to create a hip and happening business and who is, because of this, hardly getting enough sleep.

The Jules Ostin character stayed too clean, too perfect. But it's not Anne Hathaway's fault. I think she followed direction probably very well because she and De Niro were both giving off the same kind of vibe.

The script just has too many holes. Even a crafty, energetic comedienne would not have been enough, I'm afraid. My personal guess is that the original script probably had some more edge to it, some more grownup relevance.

I think originally the 70 year old intern Ben and the 20 something Jules Ostin were meant to have had an affair and even a sexual fling in San Francisco after drinking some more alcohol in the hotel room from the mini bar (both already having had quite some wine in first class on the airplane on their way to SF).

The two, in my assumed original version of the script, probably fell in love from the get go. Creating some romantic tension between the two people from different generations. The affair of Ostin's husband would have been the reason then, for her to decide to act on the strong romantic feelings and the sexual attraction.

Most likely, again it's my personal theory, somewhere along the line or Nancy Meyer or Warner Brothers decided it would be too edgy or too whatever. And they decided to go more conservative, for commercial reasons. And then they came up with the Masseuse - some very nice acting by Renee Russo - to put in some real needed romance.

But also the romance between intern Ben and company masseuse Fiona and the sexual attraction they feel for each other is missing depth, edginess and perhaps some heartfelt comedic realness. Probably because the masseuse character was created at the last minute. Thus by failing to create a just enough three dimensional developing relationship between the two, they took out all the soul and fun out of the movie.

I would have preferred the sexual tension and romantic feelings between the 70 year old and the 20 something year old, over the more edgy comedic option. Because I also think that this was the original premise. It would have given the movie some real adult relevance and the sub-title 'Experience never gets old' would have been way more multi layered in its meaning.

The movie would have also referred to the 1967 movie 'The Graduate' with the difference that now a young woman would be falling for an older man instead of a young man for an older woman. With the intelligent light weightiness of a Nancy Meyer movie of course.

The non sexual tension between young boss and old intern version, like it is now, could have worked but also then the whole script and all the dialogues would have needed to be completely rewritten. Another actress and probably another actor should have been hired: more comedy for the young boss and then Ben the intern should have been more of a dandyesque character who had seen the world. To make it all interesting for us.

The final version as we know it now probably was rewritten last minute and then they did not have enough time to really fine tune it all.

It would have been nice to have seen some real love and attraction between the two main characters, for them eventually to say goodbye to each other, going back towards their old but renewed lives. It would have been a big adventure and life lesson for them as well for us, the audience.", 1/10,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

michaelberanek275,"Touching and endearing and very clever but overlong The powerful chemistry between the sagific Robert De Niro and the brilliant Anne Hathaway make this film. With the great supporting cast and dialogue and the ever so cool contemporary cultural references this would be a 10/10 if not for a lack of editing. There are too many irrelevant subplots making it sag a bit. But this is niggling as I found much of this both funny and moving and it works as an intelligent exploration of relationships, identity, purpose i.e all the important stuff. Intern is a calibre production that engages us and earns at least enough loyalty to keep our bums on seats for 120 minutes.

Tanay_LKO,"The Feel-good ""Intern""-ship into the Light-hearted Life A light-hearted, simple and a ""textbook"" film of-sorts on the independent lives of people in business, the age of e-commerce amalgamated with the philosophy of ""life in the years"" through the events of a retired 70-year old widowed man, returning to - as he called it - ""play the music, still left within"".

What immediately strikes about the film is its ""good will aura"" through its smooth transition of scenes and the cool-coloured theme. Practically everything about it defines ""pleasantness"" - even in the slightly- pensive and troubling scenes, with a level of impact. A few surprisingly strong moments were those ""small-talks"" - an instance would be when De Niro during a post-work conversation with his employer Hathaway, tells her that their current work spaces were refurbished on the then defunct phone book factory where he worked for 40 odd years - and the very moment when Hathaway's eyes light up, one tends to feel the same apparent effervescence.

The popularly fundamental elements of a drama-comedy (or any film, for that fact)- the Music (Theodore Shapiro, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""), the Editing (Robert Leighton, ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Chef"") and the Cinematography (Stephen Goldblatt, ""Julie & Julia"" and ""The Help"") - are gigantic contributors in this wisely directed film by Nancy Meyers (""What Women Want"").

Although, a little ""too sugary"" on occasions, which seem artificial and redundant in some scenes, the film transcends on to a different level altogether while lightly touching upon the much debatable topic ""sexism at work"", subsequently phasing out with the experience (which ""never gets old"") and never- say-die human spirit. A problem risen, a solution delivered - the treatment was clear and distinct.

LIKABLE and a fine example of feel-good film of our times!!

Franklie,"De Niro perfect, film is great but needs a bit more pizzaz Unlike most of today's movies, this one isn't full of clownishness and gutter jokes, which was VERY refreshing. The characters seem like actual people that might actually exist. What a concept!

De Niro's character is so beautiful that I wished he was MY uncle or neighbor or co-worker. His character is a spot-on unassuming guru with understated rather than preachy wisdom. Perfect. Calm and steady wins the race, especially when everyone else is freaking out.

Only changes I'd make would be to evolve past using any foul language (which is witless) and I'd spice things up a bit. There are moments that seem slow or a bit too melodramatic. I also would have liked to see more of Linda Lavin (one of my faves) since the first meeting with Rene Russo was a bit creepy. Funny, but creepy. "")

imdbusrr,"countering the common criticisms The film is being dismissed as 'light comedy'. That is selling it short. Lightness of touch, otherwise known as subtlety, is not the same as insipidity, which is what a many reviewers are saying or implying is the case here. The absence of explosions/shootings may have something to do with some reviewers' feeling somewhat at a loss, but like immature people they are quick to blame the film on this rather than look to their own perceptions or deeper into the material at hand, which is plenty rich. Fourbytwos over the head are not always needed, especially with an older, more experienced audience.

Fault has been found with the soundtrack, which also lacks explosions and has been felt to be anodyne. Again, no fourbytwos. The director respects the intelligence and wisdom of the audience and does not belt them over the head aurally with cues to emote NOW and NOW, THUS.

This lack of overt guidance is too much for some. One reviewer complains about gear shifts and intolerable thematic justapositions (comic heist/workplace sexism) and unexpected plot shifts. It seems the 3-act play has built itself into the cranial boneage of some people. They're the lovers of Johann Strauss and never Bartok, of meat and 3 veg, of everything familiar. Interesting that the lack of violence, extremity and bangs and crashes in general in The Intern is problematic for them while at the same time they don't cope with a little play around story structure. This is how desensitised we've become in one direction, while remaining absolutely reactionary in another. Just like some teenagers, mistaking costume variation (to limited degrees) for radicalism.

Older audiences will recognise the themes and challenges to the characters in the film, and the pains they bring. Enough said. And now focus on the wisdoms that are displayed here for the picking. They are many.", 9/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

vanindravanindra,"Just wholesome all the way through The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway in this film is really amazing. I can feel Ben (De Niro's character) slowly becoming some kind of a father figure for Jules (Hathaway character). I also love the approach given where Ben is portrayed as a very humble worker who understands his position as an Intern, despite of his 40 years of working experience. He is willing to adapt with the youth environment, erasing the stigmas on elderly hating the youth. Kudos for the writers to make such an amazing characters and making no useless conflict in the movie.

However, there are some things I wished were explored a little bit further. One of which is the relationship between Jules and her parents. It seems like they do not have a healthy relationship, and. I just feel a little closure on that would be amazing for Jules' character arc.

More or less, really love this movie and how wholesome the movie is. I must have been aww-ing at least 50 times while watching this movie lol.", 9/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

pamma09,"Predictable OK I was really looking forward to this movie. I love DeNiro and Hathaway and they were cast well. The story starts out well - 70 yr old needing something to do with his life other than travel and play golf. Founder of a company forgets she is going to have an intern - busy with a growing company and trying to have it all at work and home. The story line of the relationship between the two main characters is well done however I would rather have seen a possible takeover rather than the marriage falling apart. That part of the script was not handled well - this CEO would have handled it differently and I really do not think she would have been the sheepish woman she was presented as. SO for me 80% of the movie was predictable and OK - the rest not so great. A good enough afternoon get away but not a great movie.

fthelmim,"Whyyyy In general i liked the movie, is a good one when u dont want to use your head for anything.

I actually watched this at my manicure's salon. TWICE

The only think that bothers me is the ridiculous attemps of throwing in some nonsense sexual implied scenes... that really didnt have to be there, it just didnt make sense, and it was very cringe to watch. Apart from that, its an alright movie, no hard feelings. Whatever.

dscharret,"did a toddler write this? This debacle was at least 1 hour too long, for the middle school script.I'm still not sure there was a point to the movie. The ending came mercifully too late, and if that was an ending, the viewer has no idea. Other than betting heavily on the Seahawks...I cant imagine why Robert Deniro would have anything to do with this horrid hack job. the plot was so weak, so amazingly weak! Even the wife apologized for having set this destruction of a good evening into motion. honestly, the movie is bad on so many levels, it cant be over stated. unless you're really looking for a nap, or just had a brain tumor removed, this train wreck is going to disappoint!! Just pathetic....

Oberrated,"Taste of old and new ""The Intern"" is a great ""feel-good"" movie filled with comedy, a laid- back plot, emotional heart-pulling moments, and it was an overall fun film. I am a huge fan of both De Niro and Hathaway, the two are highly decorated stars in the film world and their ability to create chemistry was worthy of applause. De Niro at the age of 72 still has the same acting magic that he had in his younger days and Hathaway is an absolute gem in every aspect. The film appeals to audiences of all ages with comedic quips that the older audiences can love and appreciate as well as moments that have young adults and adults laughing in their seats. Overall, I enjoyed this movie for a nice change of pace with all the action and diverse plot lines that Hollywood has been dishing out lately. It is nice to relax to a feel-good film with a highly talented cast simply enjoying themselves, as it seems.

headsign,"Hits every cliché. I was somewhat tricked into watching this movie, by reading positive reviews on IMDB, so I spent the whole 2 hours and one minute waiting for something funny, exciting or in any way uplifting to happen. Nada. This movie is just a run-of-the-mill collection of tropes and clichés, set on a background of your usual feelgood music. Yes, Robert de Niro is always nice. He's a good actor and a classy old character. Unfortunately, this is where this two-hour long advertisement commercial's (lots of very in-your-face product placement in this one) qualities end. Now, I'm pretty sure that a lot of people just like these two hours of head massage, but it's definitely not for me.

As for the humour that was expected to be seen: I couldn't detect the smallest bit of it. Just one feelgood scene with strings and harp after another. De Niro as Mr Nice-old-man, Anne Hathaway as the stressed executive. First part, they don't get along, but eventually they do. Who would have thought? Nah, really. I'm not upset because this movie exists. It should, probably. It's just not for me, and, considering how I felt tricked into watching it by overly positive reviews: here's my overly sincere one.", 7/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

stebird,"Calling all seniors, think you're done with work, think again! Now here's a film that's guaranteed to bring a warming smile to your face, thanks in part to the masterful acting and legendary presence of one Robert De Niro.

A wonderfully crafted film that shows that age is just a number, you're never too old to go to work, and I personally think the senior intern program is actually a novel idea (don't speak too loud it'll give our current government ideas!)

Anne Hathaway is a gem, a serious contender for future legend, just as her co-star currently is..., she embodies what it is to be head of a start up company whilst trying to be a good mom, a good wife and a good boss, never has a minute, barely sleeps, works more hours than there is in a day just to make a success of herself and her business.

It felt like a classy, classic film even though it's still very new and will probably grow better with age..., I cannot really fault it and where I can I'd just be being picky.

A subtle blend of the old with the new..., old school Ben (De Niro) comes into an informal modern and overly trendy e-commerce business wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, whilst his co-workers are young and hip and haven't got an ounce of self-respect between them; just as Ben tries to fit into their world, the new world..., he helps his co- workers learn about themselves, learn some self-respect, and that the old ways are sometimes the best ways.

The relationship that develops between Ben and Jules (Hathaway) is beautifully done, and it proves that even in the modern day, a close relationship doesn't have to be sexual in any way..., and it teaches people, especially modern people how to actually earn respect and organically grow a non-sexual relationship over a period of time, and proves that everything isn't instant gratification and you have to work at things, regardless of how old you are.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

IdlyViswanath,"A Truly Heartwarming Flick I really liked what this movie was trying to say with the tagline ""Experience Never Gets Old."" The society we live devalues the elderly, but this movie attempts to reinstate our respect and realize their value. The experience and wisdom aspect of the film really does hold up.

Coming to the movie, Nancy Meyer's The Intern is about Ben (Robert De Niro) who is tired of retirement and starts working as an senior intern at a new e-shopping company run by Jules (Anne Hathaway). The movie is about how he gets close to Jules and helps her both professionally and personally. The feel it creates is something I can totally get behind, feels like I just got a large cuddle from the movie itself.

The movie doesn't promise too much, it doesn't expect to be this movie that will blow you away with hilarious laughter, serious scenes, or some other thing. It is a subtle film trying to send the message that the elderly have a lot to offer and manages to be fun and entertaining. It is a wholesome film that manages to keep a smile on your face throughout the movie. There is just a kind of pleasantness in seeing De Niro's older character come into the life of Anne Hathaway as an accomplished person himself and help her out with some aspects of life.

The conversations between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro are enough to make this film at least a one-time watch. Their chemistry was just on point and it took the level of wholesomeness up a notch. I really enjoyed watching this movie and did not watch much of De Niro's comedies prior to this so was surprised by how well he did in this movie.

The film does feel like it is setting up some stuff at multiple points but it doesn't do anything too crazy, although the cheating plot thread was a little weird and felt like it could have been replaced with something little less deep.

Overall, this is a feel-good movie which is definitely worth watching for how heartwarming it is. While being a fun movie it reminds you the value of elders, serving as a win-win for Nancy Meyers.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

kenny-kuni,"good give it a 9, not because of the storyline but Anne and Robert, it seems no matter how brilliant you are, there's always a space to fill in elder's words. In personal life or professional area, you can fine useful giver nearby~ As for feminist part, i really don't get it, she works so hard to keep the business booming and under 100% of her control, however, there seems to be so many unorganized processes in the company, why its so wrong to hire someone helpful to give her a hand? its not necessarily to replace her, instead, help her run the business smoothly~ But to be honest, though her husband did terrible things, if you have no time for your partner, whats the point to be together? Just want someone to buried with after life?

The Intern is a totally different comedy movie. I must say I'm very pleased with this movie. The story line altogether was very unique and different. Upon that the legend Robert De Niro, what a fantastic acting by this man. Anne Hathaway looked brilliant in this movie and she also made a great impact in this movie. Well, if you are a Comedy Genre fan, you can very much go for this movie. This movie cannot get any much better. Best Comic Movie of the year 2015, THE INTERN.

briansusankylerachel,"How One ""Actor"" Took Down an Entire Movie. Yes, that's right, Anders Holm was so incredibly bad that in the middle of an otherwise entertaining movie, that the only thing I could think about was how good the other actors were to offset his incompetency. He was so awful, so monotonic, so fake emotionally that I was drawn completely out of the story. I wonder how many thousands of takes it took to just get him through the flotsam of slop of cuts he left in his wake? Anders Holm. Is. That. Bad.

This was a bright, light script and De Niro absolutely made the movie. His character was endearing, and he played it seamlessly and expressively. While I like him in meatier scripts, he showed his versatility and makes acting look like a profession and art, not just an exercise in repeating memorized lines. Too bad Anders Holm wasn't paying attention and sank a pretty nice ship.

When 70-year old Ben Whittaker; Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, Limitless) finds out that being a pensioner isn't all it's cracked up to be, and comes across an ad for a start-up e-commerce fashion company looking for retired people as interns, he doesn't hesitate to apply. Appointed as the personal intern to the head of the company, Jules; Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables, Alice in Wonderland), he has some challenges ahead, as she's not the easiest of people to deal with.

Slowly they warm to each other, and Ben, being the perfect gentleman that he is, gets Jules to open up to him in ways that she wouldn't with other employees.

alex_g_1928,"A sad love letter to late stage captialism I guess the title says it all. Essentially the movie is a ""passing of the torch"" kind of story that tries to convey that capitalism is a good thing for everyone, and that it always was and always will be with us.

DeNiro's character represents ""the old guard,"" while Hathaway portrays the newer generation, and they have a very predictable mentor-teacher relationship.

While telling a ton of endearing feel-good stories about working hard and getting your pay off, the film unknowingly establishes the reality of the failed meritocracy. The story's hero is someone who comes out of retirement and starts working at an entry-level job. He does it not for any financial reason but because he is ""bored."" He is very laid back and calm, while (younger) people around him are nervous, suffer, and don't know what to do. Leaving aside the unrealism of it all (in most cases, people have a hard time retiring and then keeping living in NY), the film shows that actually, the only people who can feel comfortable in the cutthroat capitalist reality are people who don't have anything invested in it.

While the cinematography is great, the film looks expensive and all; there is nothing of substance here, only a very predictable narrative that will anger anyone who is not 100% in the rat race.", 5/10,"2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

wackoreviews,"De Niro can do anything Starting a new job can be a difficult challenge, especially if you're already retired. Looking to get back into the game, 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) seizes the opportunity to become a senior intern at an online fashion site. Ben soon becomes popular with his younger co-workers, including Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the boss and founder of the company. Whittaker's charm, wisdom and sense of humor help him develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules.

The Intern is a feel-good comedy drama movie that is very enjoyable when you are tired and simply want something light to watch.

Hathaway and De Niro are perfect for their roles and have a great chemistry that is so effective, it brings the whole movie together. Although De Niro's role is not nearly as difficult and astonishing as his very serious roles, like his role in The Godfather for example, he puts on a very good performance as the experienced 70-year-old intern. This character he portrays gives advice to his boss Jules Ostin, who has to juggle the work that comes with being CEO, and the compassion and support she has to provide as a mother and a wife.

My problem with this movie is that it is very predictable. The story is kind of plain, so the audience can predict most of the events that come about throughout the journey of both characters. Also, I felt like there was so much focus on Hathaway's character and her struggles towards the end, that De Niro's character was neglected.

However, it must be said that the movie is quite funny and enjoyable. The comedic scenes with the guys from work and Ostin's daughter were specifically very amusing. So, if you are looking for a movie that doesn't provoke any thoughts and emotions, that you can watch at the end of the day while tucked in your bed, and cozily drinking a cup of hot chocolate, this is the perfect movie for you.

burnzyburns,"A nice light-hearted film Robert De Niro does something for a change and stars in a warm fuzzy watch in The Intern. A man, who was once high in power, takes a lighter position for a company where he has to work under Anne Hathaway's wing. He has seen the world of work and as the movie goes he tries to provide inside to Hathaway. What starts out as a rocky relationship becomes a bit deeper and eventually settling.

Seeing De Niro in a movie that's not nominated for an academy can come with its risks, I don't like Bad Grandpa, and Little Fockers is a disaster, but his charming sense and whit really works for this. And if it was anyone else in his role for this movie, it may not have been the same experience at least through my eyes.

I'll mention Anne Hathaway quickly who thrives in com-drams. She's a good actor and she worked out very well for this role.

There was one point in the movie I didn't like very much, mostly because I found it to be extremely unrealistic. It involves Hathaway and her husband, and it's not what he does to her but rather the conclusion they come to about the problem. That sub-plot could've and should've had a different outcome. It doesn't ruin the movie but I would've preferred a better outcome for said scenario.

De Niro and Hathaway will keep your attention.

serizaloza,"Wholesome This is usually not my type of movie, but the unusual situation Robert De Niro plays in was entertaining and had me curious as to how things would play out. From the beginning of the movie, Ben Whittaker stood out like an odd duck among his new, much younger, ""hipper"" peers. Despite not being given much to do, Ben was determined to be productive and soon enough those he worked with were charmed by his wizened, gentle, and reliable character. Ben even ended up in an unlikely friendship with his younger, driven, workaholic boss, Jules. It was touching to watch they're friendship slowly unfold to the point where they both became important people in each other's lives. This movie starts off with a 70-year-old, retired, widower hoping to fill the emptiness he feels and ends with him gaining another fulfilling purpose and friends that are like family.", 7/10,"1 out of 1 found this helpful.

""The Intern"" is a delightful feel-good movie that captivates audiences with its heartwarming story and well-rounded characters. Fiona, Ben, and Jules shine on screen, each bringing a unique charm to the narrative. Robert De Niro's portrayal of the intern, Ben, is endearing and adds a touch of wisdom to the film.

The movie's wholesome nature is a refreshing break from the usual action-packed or intense dramas. It beautifully explores the themes of mentorship, friendship, and finding purpose in unexpected places. The interactions between the characters are genuine and touching, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.

""The Intern"" is a perfect choice for a relaxing movie night. Its engaging plot and genuine emotions make it a go-to film for those seeking a heartwarming experience. The seamless blend of humor and tender moments keeps you entertained from start to finish.

While some may find the plot predictable, the movie's execution and performances more than compensate for it. Nancy Meyers' direction ensures a visually appealing and emotionally resonant journey.

In conclusion, ""The Intern"" is a heartening and uplifting film that leaves you with a warm feeling long after the credits roll. It's a movie that reminds us of the importance of human connections and the joy of embracing unexpected friendships.

keithlovesmovies,"The Intern Review Looking to fill a hole in his life, 70-year-old retired widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) decides to challenge himself by starting a new job as a senior intern for an online fashion site. Over the course of working there, Ben becomes popular with his fellow, mostly younger, co-workers, including his boss and the founder of the company, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Ben's charm, wisdom, and sense of humor help him to quickly develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules.

I would first like to say that I am not normally a fan of these types of films but I chose to see it being that I am a big Robert De Niro fan. The vanilla story isn't anything too original here and you can probably predict how it's going to go but I didn't mind that too much. It also isn't very plausible or realistic so you are forced to slightly suspend belief here. Despite all of that, the thing that kept me going were the performances of De Niro and Hathaway but more specifically De Niro. He is just oozing with charm and class here and still has great comedic timing here. He also had great chemistry with all of the other actors including Hathaway with whom he spends most of his scenes with. They play very well off of each other which makes their character's relationship more believable and relatable. Hathaway was great too but I feel like her role could have been played by someone else and would have been just as good. As I mentioned before, the film does have some comedic moments that I enjoyed for the most part mostly revolving around De Niro being an older person working with mostly younger people. Since he is older, he doesn't know much about young people things and they don't know much about older people things either. Most of the comedy comes from his trying to understand all of these things and about how this predominantly younger world works. This is done through his interactions with his fellow co-workers including Jason (Adam Devine), Davis (Zack Pearlman), and Lewis (Jason Orley) and with Jules and her family including her husband Matt (Anders Holm) and her daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner). I thought these scenes were done well. I also thought the script was well done, more specifically the characters who I thought were very well written as they all seemed like real, relatable people. Going back to the story, what would have made this film better in my mind is if the story had a little more depth to it. I think it tried to do many things but did not succeed at all of them. Either it could have done less or explore the topics it tried to suggest more deeply. It tries to bring up topics such as generational gaps, women's equality, the life of a widower, etc but just glosses over them. Even with that, I still enjoyed it and gets my recommendation solely on the performances of De Niro and Hathaway.

fluturoj,"Heart-warming Real-life link: the movie deals with a number of real-life issues and does a great job to portray them as realistically as possible. It shows the issues that running a stat-up entails, a lot of work, crazy hours, little sleep, poor diet, and most importantly the endangering of personal relationships. It also deals with the confusion of gender roles that couples face. According to society, the successful partner and the stay at home parent are predetermined by gender and when those genders gets switched it causes confusion and problems in the marriage even if both want that not to happen. I loved how Jules marriage turned out not to be the perfect one that we first thought (even tho in the end it goes back to perfect).

Another thing that I loved is that the movie also dealt a bit with forgiveness and understanding (when Jules forgives and tries to understand her husband's affair). It is good to be shown that not everything is done with a bad intention. And sometimes when the one doing wrong understands his or her mistake and asks for forgiveness, he or she actually means it and deserve to be forgiven (this however brought the couple back to perfection which moved the movie away from reality). It is this what makes you happy instead of thinking 'that I am too good to put up with this' or that 'I will never tolerate someone cheating on me'. I am not saying that it should be tolerated and accepted, I am just saying that in some cases it makes you happier to try and understand the other person and see if there is room for forgiveness. At the end of the day we are all humans and we all make mistakes and most importantly what we all want is to be loved and cared about.

Character analysis: Jules character was deep, lovable and quite real. She kept the positive attitude despite the workload and stress and seemed to always be in a good mood because she loved what she did. A good hearted person who had someone who loved her enough to push her into pursing her dreams because sometimes all it takes is a push. Good hearted enough to be able to forgive and to try and understand why someone behaved as s/he did by at the same time trying to understand what she did wrong to contribute to that behaviour. And all this despite being mad as every normal person would.

Matt-not deep enough but real. The sad truth is that a lot of men feel emasculated with a more successful woman so they cheat to feel like a man again. It is what society does. It confuses people about the gender role. Despite this however, cheating must not be justified. If you cheat once (no matter circumstances) it is hard to believe that you are as good and perfect as the movie wants us to believe that Matt is.

Ben-such a cute and lovable character. However, I found it to be a bit too shallow. The observant, the listener. But still wise and probably the real reflection of an older's person behaviour in a workplace like the one in the movie. Patty and Fiona- not to much from them but just enough to show ( for a thousand times in movies) that when a men is interested it will make it happen. If not, there is not much you can do I guess, just take the hint and walk away (with exceptions of course).

Overall a heartwarming and interesting movie. One thing however, i though that Ben was gonna become the CEO so that Jules can still run the company without an outsider given her orders. I was convinced about this the whole movie. Imagine my surprise when non of that happened and the movie finished suddenly. So yeah, that could have been a plot options.

So to sum up, a great movie and I would defiantly recommend it.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jillbeckinheim7,"I liked it! Beyond the cast, the script, direction and cinematography all made the just over two hour film a breeze and never ceased to make me smile. It was hilarious, touching though never unconvincing and certainly moving with the example Ben leads.

Retired Ben did everything he wanted to early in his retirement, but when the freshness wore off, he was afraid to whiter away. Fortunately, he found a new spark as a ""Senior Intern"" in a completely opposite young adult internet firm. At first, no one, including Jules, knew how to take him, but good ole Ben, unintentionally became the star, friend and mentor to everyone there.

In no way did this movie feel unrealistic, or misguided to what could happen. It was so well written and driving, you could feel as if you were there in that office with him. You'd want to be there. You'd want to be Ben's peer and friend.

archiecm,"Wasn't the ending I wanted I really enjoyed this film. I overlooked that Ben was perfect. I mean, he had no faults. Do those people really exist? Why have I never met any of them? But I liked him so . . . .

What bothered me was the ending where Jules ignored Ben's advice and gave her philandering husband another chance. I realize she still loved him but I didn't want to see it. The reason is because he was the least likable of all the characters in the movie. He wasn't all that charming even with his kid when they were at play. He had no irony, wit, humor or charm. I couldn't see why Jules married him except that she talked him up during their early marriage days. So I wanted her to ditch him and go through the grief before finding someone more on her level. That's just me, perhaps. I've never been married and the history there may color my perceptions. Good film though. I laughed.", 5/10,"0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

PhilmGuru,"A simple pleasure It's such a rare joy to watch a film these days that doesn't rely on special effects, bad language, violence or crude humour.

While I enjoy all of the above, in the correct context, and they certainly have their place - this film stands out as true gem to remind the current generation that they might just be missing out on something better (and simpler) by constantly 'dressing down' to be cool.

To see the sloppy start-up culture (of which I'm somewhat a part) juxtaposed against De Niro's sharp suits and clear language, serves notice that being caring, human and honest is not forgotten among a lot of people and will always be honoured & respected.

BOTH protagonists are hero characters - funny, caring, touching, warm and forgiving.

Serotonin and dopamine fire simultaneously watching this film from start to finish. In part, due to the fact these characters simply don't exist in real-life anymore... as much as they really should.

I would advise anyone with a warm to heart to watch this and simply give in to it.

Accept it's Hollywood, accept it's Hollywood showing us a different side, a side it's more than capable of showing us. If we don't accept it, we only have the dark side left.

malpasc-391-915380,"Sweet, funny comedy I really enjoy this film. Ok, its not particularly deep and it doesn't require much thought to understand the plot. But what it does is entertain and charm, and isn't that what we watch films for mostly? To be entertained.

The leads play their roles well - Robert De Niro as a retired 70 year old widower who is finding retirement somewhat boring and lonely takes the opportunity to do an internship at Jules Ostin's (Anne Hathaway) online fashion company. This film could have gone down the cliched route of De Niro's character Ben messing up because he isn't aware of the latest technologies or business practices of a start-up run by a millennial. Instead it shows that the older guy can impart his knowledge of business to this modern crowd, and at the same time find a sense of purpose, belonging, friendship and a new love along the way.

There are one or two very silly, almost ""slapstick"" comedy setups which if overdone or too many in quantity would have spoiled the movie and made it something it isn't. Luckily we don't get a lot of cheap and all too obvious ""laughs"" here. There is also a focus on a more serious side of a suddenly successful business - that it can have an impact on the personal relationships of the people running the business. This is covered very well, and quite sweetly.

I've seen The Intern twice now, as its currently available on one of the subscription services I have at home. Both times I've really enjoyed it. Its a very sweet, funny comedy that doesn't overly cliche either the older or younger characters.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

ihgomaa-724-693945,"Promising Movie with a Terrible Ending The movie started off well. Robert DeNiro played a calm role he'd never played before (whereas his previous roles were all either mobster or angry father). Robert DeNiro was incredibly charming and his chemistry with Anne Hathaway was perfect. The next part of this review is where the spoilers come in.

First problem was nothing was resolved: The intern is still living with DeNiro, we never find out if Jason and Becky end up together, they go nowhere with DeNiro's admirer, we don't find out where his relationship gets with the Masseuse, we don't know if Anne Hathaway made the right choice about her company in the end.

The second, and much BIGGER problem: this movie is a life lesson that as long as a man cheats on you, it's OK as long as he apologizes and says he loves you. I expected her to tell him no and end up falling with the new CEO or something. Hell, I would have even accepted her just sticking it out with DeNiro in the end. They go with the absolute worse possible ending, making the cheater forgiven, and having them ""live happily ever after.""... you know... until he cheats on her again and the family is torn apart.", 9/10,"2 out of 5 found this helpful.

koen_smit,"I went to bed with a smile on my face, I really liked this movie. I simply loved this movie. Anne Hathaway plays this modern business woman with a heart and soul and Robert deNiro is lovable from the first second you see him.

He's been there, done that and just needs something to do. So he applies for a senior internship at this new-fashioned fast rising web shop. His boss, a young woman with a dream, is trying to keep the control of everything that happened since her idea became a huge success and combine this with having a family. At first she doesn't want him around, but after a while she starts feeling comfortable and at ease when he slowly but surely starts to help her (without her even noticing it at first).

His devotion to help his boss is something I can relate to, and the hip and modern environment they work in I recognize as well. All is done very well, the characters (not all deeply layered, but that's not necessary for a light comedy) are truthful, the story is running with a nice pace and deNiro and Hathaway are a very good match.

I've been watching it for 2 weeks no and I keep putting it on and after 20 minutes I get distracted as is has no real depth to draw me in. Ended up reminding me of 'the internship' which is 10x better in many aspects. So I once again paused the intern to watch a full 2 hours of something else which confirmed to me that I just need to give up trying.

tyingling7766,"For everyone Today I am doing a movie review. Now, the movie review that I would do won't always be a recent movie, but it will be a movie all the same. Today's movie is one from 2015 called The Intern.

Synopsis: 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin. Starring: Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway Director: Nancy Meyers

Some are probably thinking why I would watch this movie, I was suggested this movie by my parents. And I'm glad I watched this movie. It is really good and has a proper meaning.

That meaning: Everyone needs help once in a while.

Robert De Niro is masterful as the old, wise, seasoned worker. Anne Hathaway has the look of the overworked, modern mom to begin, so it wasn't that much of a stretch to see her in this movie. The two of them played off each other so well that it only helped the movie.

Like I said, the meaning of the movie is to get help if you need it. Things just begin to get out of hand for the boss and it only takes one person to help her out and realize the error of her ways. It's not that uncommon of a story. A lot of people go through the same problem every day. I just wish this movie came out a few years ago, it may have helped me.

Nancy Meyers is a very good director. She has made quite a few movies that I have liked. This one is no different. She knows how to make a sentimental movie with a great story.

I am strongly suggesting this movie to everyone. It doesn't matter what type of movies you like; this movie is for you.

tenyearreunion,"You know what you are going to get, right? I'm not surprised this movie has started with a relatively high IMDb score of over 7.

You know it's going to be a saccharin popcorn movie with a artificially sweet taste but do you know what? That is fine with me.

It perked me up, the pacing is right, as is the tone of the film. The nay sayers may complain about product placement but it's 'that' sort of film to be expected and as long as it never distracts from the script or storyline (err...Rolex? No Omega') it becomes white noise to me.

De Niro is no longer a gangster in the world of Hollywood, and I have found some of his roles a bit painful of late, but he does really well here and the character is well suited to him as is the casting of Miss Hathaway.

Feel good? Wanna feel a little better? Give The Intern a chance and see where it takes you.

Snorreplop,"So sweet it will make your teeth hurt Jules Ostin runs a successful internet fashion start-up, but she has trouble combining business with her family live. Ben Whittaker, a 70 year old retired widower is looking for a way to give more meaning to his empty and unproductive live. When he spots an add for a senior citizen internship, applies to it and eventually gets the position, the two are teamed up.

Do not expect a lot of depth or insight from this comedy. The movie lightly meanders from start to its unfulfilling end. The only thing that keeps this movie from totally caving in on itself is the talent and charm of mostly Hathaway and to some extent De Niro, the latter acts on autopilot for most of the movie.

melinetto,"lovely film from Hathaway and De Niro I really enjoyed this move. There's a great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro throughout the entire movie. And both of them give wonderful performances thus the quality of the film lifted up by them.

I do like the idea of ""senior internship program"" which is Ben got the job at the firm in this way. I, found this idea that is very creative. Also, i like the scenes which is Russo and De Niro in it. This duo maintain and keep the sense of humor in film at a certain level. However, i don't like the ending because you know, it has kinda feminist side and female character leads the way which i like but she forgives her cheating husband at the end. Personally, it should've been ended differently.

In general, even though i didn't like the ending, it's a lovely film and it's worth watching.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

prprincess90,"The Feel Good Comedy of the Year! Wonderful offering from Writer-Director Nancy Meyers that is INDEED ""The Feel Good Comedy of the Year!"" Robert DeNiro plays Ben a 70-year-old retiree, struggling to enjoy his days alone. When he spots an ad for a ""Senior Internship,"" working for a successful internet start-up, he relishes the opportunity.

After getting the internship, he is assigned to the head of the company, Jules Ostin, played rather nicely by Anne Hathaway. While Jules is not so quick to appreciate Ben - or the program in general - she eventually warms up to him and the idea. The two form a strong bond, and Jules comes to see Ben, not only as an asset, but a close and trustworthy friend.

Their bond is the crux of this movie and holds it together. There is an especially uncomfortable (at first) yet heartwarming scene, where Jules invites Ben to lay down in her bed late one night on a business trip. DeNiro is spot-on as his Ben keeps one foot on the floor with a priceless expression on his face. Yet, by the end of the scene, the two of them are even closer. There is nothing Romantic about this scene, it is more about the close bonds of friendship.

I won't reveal anymore other than to say the abrupt ending was very satisfying to me. See it, you won't be disappointed!", 8/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jpjeffery,"Schmaltz, schmaltz, and more schmaltz If you want schmaltz and no surprises, this is the movie for you.

Every plot twist, is barely a twist at all, and often predictable (oh look, Jules' apparently-perfect-at- being-a-house-husband husband Matt is having and affair, and Ben finds out completely by accident by just happening to turn down the road where Matt has just met up with his mistress)

But you know, many people like exactly that kind of movie, and this is a well made example of the genre. Robert De Niro proves (again) that he is a really good all round actor (not just a tough guy actor), and Anne Hathaway is also excellent, if a little 'gushy' (though, to be fair, that gushy-ness is more a reflection of her character than her acting skills).

So, it wasn't great, but it wasn't exactly awful either, and if this is the kind of movie that you like then you'll probably love it.", 8/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

fearlessone-82664,"Good Cast, Terrible Story At first glance this movie seems like a decent movie but it's really not...

Synopsis: A privilege white woman with mommy issues and too much opportunity starts a business off an unoriginal idea (cause online clothes shopping is nothing new), gets sad when she's too successful and starts an inappropriate friendship with an old intern who decided that a life time of working and having the chance to actually retire is too boring in a world where millions of people can only dream of retirement one day and decides to apply to work for said white woman for free.

Said woman is riddled with guilt about her success because her spoiled hipster husband stays at home, contributes nothing but minimal parenting responsibility and then decides to cheat because his ego is so fragile that he can't stand his wife being a successful human being. Over the course of a month (or maybe 2?) nothing changes except that said woman stays with piece of child man child after a half ass apology. Old guy who had a lifetime of happiness with his now deceased wife gets a girlfriend because being alone is bad. Ends with Tai Chi session in a park in downtown New York (somehow?) to symbolize how hard life is for white people and sometimes you just need to appropriate Chinese culture to make yourself feel better.

Overall, this movie has no substance to it. But the cast is nice to look at, I guess.", 8/10,"2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

juanthompeace,"The Intern Lacks Diversity I saw ""The Intern"" today. It was a good story and it seems that I really enjoy Nancy Meyers stories as I also liked ""The Holiday"" and ""It's Complicated."" I really appreciated watching the relationship develop between Jules and Ben which were wonderfully acted by Robert De Nero and Anne Hathaway. The writing really addresses the juggling act that 21st century professional women attempt daily. I do have to say that I was most disappointed in the lack of diversity in the cast, even the extras. It was hard to locate one person of either African or Latino descent acting as a tech professional at Jules' company, yet when she visits the company warehouse to speak to the packers (a job that presumably does not required a college education) there is where we find our first extras of color. I'm disappointed in the stereotyping and would have enjoyed the film more if the lack of diversity were not screaming out at me. Warner Brothers, please do what you can to educate Ms. Meyers and her casting directors because next time I just may keep my $10 rather than see a movie that assumes all professionals and those who live in trendy Brooklyn neighborhoods are all White.", 8/10,"7 out of 18 found this helpful.

keithsealy,"Good idea, good beginning, terrible conclusion As an older person (50yr old) who works in the tech industry, I was hopeful that this movie might show how those of us with more experience still have something to say and something to offer in today's tech world. And, the movie started as just that. If there was one flaw in the premise it was the older character was too perfect, too likable. Even someone as intelligent as him would still have struggled more than was shown. However, I can overlook that somewhat.

But, the movie had some very serious flaws...

First - The Hathaway character was not at all realistic. She was talked about as a hardass, but we never see that in her portrayal. She never yells, fires people, etc. even when expressing disappointment at the test package she sent to herself she was smiling... not at all angry. Someone who (a) is portrayed as having a passion and high standards, (b) has been able to secure VC funding and (c) been able to grow a profitable business would be much more self confident and much more demanding than was shown. The character from the other Hathaway movie, ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" would be much closer to reality than this wimpy character. I am not saying nice people don't exist in that role, but people with that sort of drive and passion tend to be more decisive and more demanding than she is portrayed.

My second large problem with the movie is the entire second half, where it shifts from being an interesting workplace story and becomes a relationship drama. It would have been much more interesting if it had stayed in the workplace. The personal stuff could have played a part, but have that been part of a greater whole, not completely consume the movie.

In conclusion... I was really disappointed with this movie. The watered down nature of the story, the cookie cutter characters, the unrealistic portrayal of the tech world and the people who inhabit it. I suspect that the original idea was written people with actual experience, but once Hollywood writers got hold of the script it became nothing but a bunch of clichés.", 6/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

kjr032,"Touching and inspirational An unusual and really enjoyable movie. De Niro and Hathaway were superb, especially as De Niro was so different than he is most of his movies. The story line is great and makes one wonder why more retired people are NOT brought in as interns, or, as (paraphrased) one person said, ""who would you rather have as an intern...a seasoned retired executive or some kid who was recently playing beer pong in college?"" The differences between the older and younger generations was subtle yet impactful. The references to the business world were quite accurate, vs many Hollywood moves wherein it is so clear that the writers are largely oblivious to the real business world. Just a joy to watch.

majoreasy,"A feel good movie with a weak ending... The movie and story started well and in fact was enjoyable throughout.

One problem with so-called 'chick flicks' is they try too hard to end it like a fairy tale...which negates trying to build the characters at the beginning. No story in real life ends happily ever after in all ways...trying to close off all loops in the nicest possible way leaves a sour taste for me because I feel cheated that I bought into the story for so long...

I'd still recommend this movie though, as I found it enjoyable for the most part...just not the ending few minutes.

It's a shame really because the first hour was great and I started to care about the characters...but by the time I walked out of the cinema, there was a mild annoyance of even bothering to care...

fahimay,"Lifts up your spirits! When I sat down to watch this, I never expected it to be a feel-good movie. Robert de Niro overwhelms us by outperforming his caliber. I actually didn't have high hopes of the movie and was pleasantly surprised. Anne Hathaway emanates simplicity and elegance, playing her role as the overworked, ambitious, lost-the-fire-in-the-marriage wife with such finesse. I had been impressed with her in ""The Devil wears Prada"" and loved seeing her here, though it was the reversed role, with her playing the boss.

With neither romance nor any personal agenda involved between the protagonists, the plot has a fresh feel. The generation gap in the corporate world puts emphasis on the fact that office-goers from the 80's feel out of place in the current techno-savvy biz world, interlinked with emails and social networks. But De Niro demonstrates his knowledge deficiency with calculated ease (which seemed a little fictitious, but we enjoy it).

How Anne seemed solid on the outside but crumbling on the inside due to a failing marriage ironically on account of her achievements was commendable. De Niros's character is truly an embodiment of positivity and diligence; most people past the age of retirement feel they have retired in life too, this movie is an eye-opener that you are never too old to live.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

remcovos85,"An entertaining feel good movie that doesn't disappoint ! This movie is one of many feel good movies around. The great thing about it is the built up of the movie and the fact that even when you know the outcome it still keeps you drawn towards the screen.

Robert de Niro once again proves his allround acting skills. He mesmerizes you throughout the movie. You feel for his character and the position he's in. Having grown up with a mum working with the elderly day in day out, she emphasizes the importance (sometimes to much in my opinion :) ) of not neglecting them and the experience and influence they still can bring to the table. Seeing the movie unfold just makes you smile. The chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro is great and the support cast is really nice in my opinion. The 'gang' gives the movie the comedic and light touch to it, although Anders Holm didn't really stand out or gave his character that much extra, he was just there.

All in all good entertainment.

I have watched a lot of movies in the past , so I was a little hesitant to purchase this one. Anna Hathaway & Robert De Niro were really good. I have loved them in other movie that they have done, so I kind of knew that it would be at least a 5 star movie. So funny in some parts and it definitely made my parents and I laugh. The little girl was so cute, she did a great job. This movie really makes you think about life today. It made me feel happy, sad, joy, & laughter. It was a long movie, but it didn't drag on like other movies did. It kept with the story.

hennyxu,"Heart In a time where action movies and expensive popcorn flicks are dominating the box-office, it's good to see a well-balanced movie with a lot of heart. Some of you may think that this movie is a chick flick, maybe because of trailers or promotional materials, but believe me this is not the case. It's a funny feel good movie with good, not over the top, drama. I Highly recommend this to everyone who wants to watch a movie, especially together, and feel good in the end.

The movie begins with a 70-year-old widower named Ben Whittaker, played by Oscar winner Robert Deniro, who is fed up with his retirement and longs for a goal/purpose in life. When suddenly an opportunity arises allowing him to apply for an senior internship at an online fashion site. He is assigned to the company's boss Jules Ostin, played by the beautiful Anne Hathaway, and from that moment on we embark on a journey where we get to know the characters.

The following will discuss the characters, music & cinematography, and the three-act-structure.

The characters within this movie are wonderful. The main characters Ben and Jules are portrait in a likable almost natural way, with moments that will evoke happiness and sadness. You can feel the relation between the two characters being built from the first moment to the last scene. The supporting characters are similarly likable, and luckily not annoying (I truly hate movies with annoying supporting characters). They are mostly funny characters used for the comedy relieve scenes, but the movie uses them in a subtle manner, which provides them a little bit of character development. In addition, remaining characters provide good dramatic support for the main characters in a not too cliché way (sorry don't want to spoil too much).

The music used is upbeat and fits the accompanying scenes, however it isn't really anything special. The cinematography is pretty good. The movie has a white gloomy feel to it, when it is showing the office or business side, and a warm and brighter look when showing family moments. Based on the three-act-structure, it has a funny energetic beginning, heartwarming middle, and a somewhat dramatic ending.

If there is one thing that is bothering me then it has to be the hammering of feminism. Please don't misunderstand me I've nothing against it and more power to it. But this movie tries to hammer it into us a little too much. Maybe they should have removed some lines or changed certain dialogs. It's a movie show us and don't repeatedly tell us. But hey, it's just a small quibble and it shouldn't bother most people (I hope). O and I think they should've trimmed the movie a little maybe 10min to better the flow :P.

Al in all it's a good movie worth watching and I promise you you'll have a good time.

I give this movie a 8.", 8/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

AdityaChaphekar,"Its the Story of Ben- ""The Intern"" I loved the film as Robert De Niro nailed it. Its the story of Ben, a 70-year old retired person who denies the concept of being retired, trying to explore the new world, joining as an intern in an E-Commerce Start Up. A man who easily charms others by the way he talks with all that experience and maturity he has in him is a delight to watch. He efficiently handles all the situations and is apt in his own old way. Jules on the other side, a classy, perfect,confident 21st Century girl who passionately runs the firm she started maintaining a work life balance. She is stuck between the decisions she has to make about her work and her family. There are few takeaways in the film. 1. To focus on the career and value the relations at the same time. 2. Be matured to handle every situation you face. 3. Explore life even after the time you are retired instead of waiting life to be withered.

I loved the mix of the cultures, the generation gap between the two and Robert-Anne chemistry. The movie ends with a positive note.", 9/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

It was OK - DeNiro was great, as ever, but Rene Russo ridiculously sidelined (cutting room floor?) and woefully underused; the housebreak scene superfluous and unnecessary, and the ending weak. It was better than some of the films DeNiro undertakes these days, but could have done with a stronger plotline with a little more realistic grit and more faceted characters. I must admit I wanted Ben to have more impact at the company - maybe be in an 'equally shared role' CEO with Jules?.", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I have watched all the ""good movies"" and mostly I watch them only but occasionally I like watching this normal drama comedy and this one was a good one. But nowdays they don't make these kinds of movies it's all just serious drama or crime. However good those movies might be but these comedy drama also have their place in movie business. Ofcourse de Niro and Anne Hatheway were delight to watch, their chemistry was too good.

Graz-4,"Time well spent Until now I've not been a fan of Anne Hathaway, though I appreciate lots of people are, but in this movie I did come to like her quite a bit. Good acting, and looking 'normal' one might say. Needless to say Robert De Niro was exemplary as usual. And Jojo Kushner (Paige) - well doesn't she just make you melt ? lovely, brainy, great actress. I have to say that the part of hubby played by Anders Holm was a bit weak. But Becky played by Christina Scherer was super and reminded me of girls I habe met at the offices I have been to on more than one occasion. All in all a very good movie that wife and self enjoyed immensely. Would see this again no problem.

joel14481-2,"This film is definitely a winner Saw this film in a theater filled with senior citizens. The laughter was literally nonstop. As I usually do, I listened to comments as I left the theater the only comments I heard were very positive. To sum them up, this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie from beginning to end. Robert Deniro and Anne Hathaway were great. He was both funny and likable. Anne Hathaway was great in her portrayal of a young, hip and highly successful internet business woman. She operates he high tech business in an old Brooklyn factory as a hands on boss. She has her finger on the pulse of every aspect of the operation, Her employees are the usual assortment of computer geeks with some fashion conscious beautiful women thrown in for good measure.

ekmungi,"Good movie I like Anne Hathaway. I watched the movie with my wife, as this was the only new English movie playing at the theatre nearby, we decided to check it out. I had heard a lot of negative reviews about the movie, I agree that Anne Hathaway could do better and that it is very stereotypical with the Devil wears Prada storyline. A female lead with a dysfunctional life. But the movie is a feel-good idealistic scenario. But I think it does what it should, moments of drama, fun and comedy and in the end leaves with a hope that life has its moments but things will be alright when one follows the heart. It does however point out the most obvious social message that is hasn't been touched, we teach young girls that they are strong and should follow their heart to lead a professional life, but miss the fact that the boys are left behind in the emotional development that is needed as a part of this change with women participating more at workplace. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I would definitely recommend for an evening to unwind.

chadwick-robbert,"It's filled with positivity and really new age Believe me, it's my first review on IMDb. Make no mistake, it's not the first film I'm watching or not even first Nancy Meyers film I'm watching but there ware something in this movie which compelled me to write.

Not only the plot is exciting but the way they have put it is simply beautiful and truly energizing. Director has really presented some things which we yet in 21st century don't give a thought about or accept rather not that easily. And one must watch the movie for that!

Needless to say, the lead cast is fantastic and ease through their characters. You will in seconds believe that they actually are who they are trying to portray. All in all, a very healthy, positive and fun filled experience it is, which makes you love your life again. And yes, truly new age!

robingoodfellow10,"One of the sweetest movies made lately Robert De Niro is the reason which made this movie so like-able. He plays an old gentleman who is so sweet that at some point, while watching the movie, you wish to be like him when you get old.

Ben, a widower who is retired, see a flier while getting some groceries about a senior intern program at a start-up. Unlike other seniors who showed up for the job he is the most full of life and physically fit. He impress every body and he is Mr. Congeniality of the company. Ben is assigned to work with Jules, CEO, who is somewhat skeptical at first. Initially frozen out by her, Ben slowly wins over co-workers with his likability and gets into Jules's good graces.

This movie is all about Robert De Niro. The way he played his character made me love this movie. He have proved them wrong who say that De Niro's career has taken a nosedive. The Intern is a family comedy which can be funny and dramatic as well.

Do yourself a favor and go watch it.", 5/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

cyn-wolf,"A good movie for all age groups to see Very amusing for both Anne Hathaway and Robert DiNero. Really think this will be a winner for both. Ann Hathaway seems to be trying her wings at different poetic scenes and she is doing very well showing that she can play different roles. Ms. Hathaway has come along way in her field and she has done well in everything that I have seen so far that she has starred in. Robert DiNero, he is a star by far. What can you say. There is no one that can top that man. I love the work that he does. He can be funny, he can be serious, he is fabulous! Mr. DiNero has worked with many women and they all seem to do much better work with him. I don't know if he is teaching them as they are doing their roles during the filming or if he just has that magic touch that brings it out when you see the film in its finished process. Priceless as they say. Great film.

tochukwu-83206,"""The Intern"" is a satisfying parental/mentor/business/family drama. The intern presents an interesting and often not-acknowledged view on retirement. For a working population, retirement presents an opportunity to rest, freedom for work shackles and pressure coupled with the delicious thought of having to travel to places seen. And Ben having seen all, done all-becomes bored. Robert de Niro still with his trademark facial expressions and mannerisms brings the character to life. More so, the film's plot buttresses and enforces that idea: retirement isn't what it seems to be. And for Ben's case, it is even more understandable given that his wife is dead-making room for lone times. Those scenes in which he goes out, without any destination in particular or have coffee in cafeterias in the hopes of having a normal conversation goes without saying that the films doesn't just presents thoughts, perspectives or opinions. It supports it with actions.

How do the over 60s age group cope with the 21St century tech suaveness: Google, face book, twitter and a host of others. After Ben joins the senior intern ship programme, it is evident, very, how he struggles with the youth vibe and culture in this new company- very different work practices from his own generation. Though he conquers-not technically, but by being everyone's friends-employing that seasoned old man's knowledge. Nevertheless, it is not properly fleshed-out. --------Genre-wise, it is hard to place ""The Internship"" a particular group. But a simplistic way of looking at it would be by calling it a parenting/mentor film. Three-quarters of the film features Robert de Niro's character Ben serving as a guidance counselor to Anne Hathaway's-in few cases saviour. Robert fits up to that billing. His character is mature to a fault. In scenes where you expect him to unknowingly make a mess of things, he doesn't. Another actor who fits this role is Morgan Freeman.

It vexes me that that Rene Russo was short changed for this role, though she has that romantic chemistry with Robert. I feel she is too big of a star to take the role of a masseuse with a few glorified cameos. Anne Hathaway stands out as Jules Ostin in her character's multidimensional abilities: wife/mother/businesswoman/CEO. However, the character strengths are downplayed while making her alienable at first sight-in a bid to make her a likable candidate for moral lessons, advice and saving. It is worth noting that the scenes between her and Robert feel relaxed and awkward at the same time. Finally, the good will of ""The Intern"" is nearly spoiled by that rushed third act finishing and glaringly playing to the audience's expectation and fantasy, but overall ""The Intern"" is a satisfying parental/mentor/business/family drama.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

KahlilHerring,"Good until end Robert and Anne killed it with their performances obviously. But i got really mad when she got back together with him at the end. SO STUPID MAN. This promotes staying with a cheater, and the mindset that everything can go back to normal in the worst situations. I was loving this movie until she got back with him I was so mad. Anyways if you're looking for a good movie to just pass time (which I was doing) it is a great movie, until the end of course. Overall it is a nice movie Anne and De Niro's chemistry was off the charts I also love the little girl, and the group of interns, very nice comradery. between them. I think the replay value of this movie is medium and I will be will looking forward to seeing it again one day.", 5/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Great, feel good movie without being over the top.

Deniro pulls of a great role as a fatherly figure who has experience and eventually pulls Anne thru most of her turmoils.

Im actually really surprised to see so many haters. I myself can be very critical, but this movie delivered for what it was set out to be.

Deniro shows that he can be versatile and is a great actor. Anne is great also she has done roles like this before.

I really liked the start up business story and bringing someone like deniro as quirky as it seems has some real good messages.

I guess some critics are just very superficial or had certain expectations coming into it before they watched it.", 9/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

goicuria,"Enjoyably Witty Today we went to see ""The Intern"" starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. Surprisingly, I rather enjoyed it. The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is really the star here and it is adeptly handled by writer/director Nancy Meyers. The ensemble cast provides a well-balanced dose of giggles, tears and panache. It's good to see De Niro not going too much over the top for laughs as he has been prone to do in recent years. Hathaway is believable in her role and you feel for her as she deals with the ups and downs of balancing her life as a successful business person and being a wife. As with so many films today, The Intern is ripe with references and examples that clearly illustrate the differences between the way things were back in the day and the whole social media-driven mentality of modern day standards of acceptance. Kudos to Anders Holm and JoJo Kushner in their respective roles as the husband and young daughter and for pulling off what almost comes across as throw away parts until too far into the film. All of this being said and without divulging spoilers, for this reviewer as with so many of these recent ""successful white collar yuppie bromantic"" type of comedy films (for lack of a better label), the ending was weak and all too predictable. Still, I give it 7 out 10 stars for effort.", 9/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

He is old-fashioned but become loved by every co-workers Jules, Anne Hathaway, is a entrepreneur and a mother. I laughed at her cycling in the office. She tries to be perfect both in the office and the house. But she gives more weight to the job, so her husband does housework. Still working women are not so popular. It is pathetic that Jules is looked coldly by other mothers. Her effort for balancing work, childcare and marital relations are very tough. She never whines about her job and home, but she only does in front of Ben. He just listens to her without saying nothing. Their relationship is charming. It makes me notice that you can be friends with anybody without regard to age or sex.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

asicengineer,"Expectation vs reality I came here expecting a masterpiece and am going back after seeing a showpiece. The story starts off with a lot of promise and has a lot of leads from which the story could have taken off in a great fashion, but till the last minute, there seems no such effort has been taken.

On what basis did Anne Hathway make the decision that Ben's (De Niro) role as an intern seems to be working after getting him transferred is beyond me. To be honest, If anyone who's handled an entire team for over 40 years (based on which he was chosen as an intern), is not observant(to get him transferred), then the person who's making the decisions(Anne Hathway) is taking baby steps in handling business and has a lot to learn.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

blitzkrieg-79640,"I expected to hate this... I expected to hate this, but De Niro is my favourite actor so I figured I'd give it a go.

I can't stand schmaltz. Can't stand jazz, soppy stories with light comedy moments, anything about New York, anything involving trendy hipsters or precocious but cute kids... and I've always thought Anne Hathaway was overrated.

Yet here I am, admitting I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Ms Hathaway was wonderfully convincing in the role. The story was wholesome (albeit with some unnecessary swearing in one instance, which soured it slightly), poignant and entertaining. And believable. The story reflects the reality of our age, and the roles we're assigned by society. It deals really well with the image of women as powerful figures, and with age-related perceptions.

The biggest let-down (only in my opinion, obviously) was from Mr De Niro. His acting in The Mission remains one of the best performances I have watched to date, but I think maybe he should choose his comedy roles more carefully.", 4/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

izmsyoko,"One 70 year old man visits a young lady who is a president of Internet shopping company to work. His honest and sincere behavior changes the company gradually. I like this movie. This story is suits modern world. Japan is aging society, so many people may sympathize with this story and this story may reflect modern social problem. I can receive the message that it is not too late to begin something even if you are 70 years old. I can have courage when I finish watching this movie.

The character of one 70 year old man and a young lady who is a president of Internet shopping company is really good. The elderly man plays an important rule to the lady overcome difficulties. The performance of the actor and actress is also good.

sionetupou-25970,"Its ok and heartwarming. Love me some Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. A comedy/drama with those two that touch on 2 different generational perspectives is interesting to me.

However the movie ended abruptly for me. Their drama felt intriguing though fleeting and sometimes forced/cringe (like the masseuse). It also feels like a flawless character Ben walks into Jules life and somewhat fixes everything about her and her situations. I was hoping for a deeper dive and clash between the two different generations (also no pushback when Jules gets drunk and dunks on the boys)

Either all its inoffensive and a fine family movie for all. Roberts character ""Ben"" inspired me to always carry a hanker-chief which is a weird take away for me.

Never liked Anne Hathaway, never will like her probably. She and her fashion diva type role really sucks. And I can never dislike Robert De Niro. So basically this movie is about my most liked actor and most disliked actress.

To be honest the day was saved by De Niro and Rene Russo, who by the still looks stunning even in her 60's. They kept the movie going till the end and actually created some genuine laughs.

The movie is the same old concept of old people catching up with new generation including the idea of stay at home husband to opening an account in Facebook. While the younger generation is learning about gentleman-ship and Chivalry.Nothing new to offer really

rakeshshetty,"Do not miss this one... As someone in your sixites, your first instinct to a 30 something giving an advice is, 'Really, you've the audacity?' So when I watched Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker trying to make himself useful as an intern at About The Fit, a startup sensation, an ecommerce company founded by Jules (Anne Hathway), by helping the delivery lady, by coming in at 7am to clear a table that was unofficially the dustbin of the office and to take Jules' blazer to laundry when she stains it, I knew this was a very interesting character in the making. But, all Ben was doing was showing you the dignity of labour and how you could totally connect to people two generations after you by just being calm and helpful.

The Intern is not a preachy movie and it is not about how a 70 year old chivalrous gentleman comes and fixes the problems in the life of Jules. In fact, he does nothing of that sort and the movie, pretty much ends where it begins, with Jules continuing to be the same driven, passionate person who would go to the warehouse and tell her workers how to pack deliveries when clothes were ordered.

The movie is not about one person saving the day for another person. It is about how small things in our everyday life could be fixed with good attitude and good humour and Ben personifies the guy who doesn't take offense at anything, loves his work (which is why he returns as an intern to a company now running in a remodelled version of his old workplace - a nice touch to the story). Ben is a great guy who tries to look like the guy next door and it helps that he teaches mannerisms like carrying a handkerchief on you so you could offer it when some lady is crying. From start to finish, the movie shows you how the big problems are rarely about the big problems. There is a lesson here for all of us, Look at your elders and learn from them as the movie tagline says ""Experience never gets old""

Well the movie does have its own flaws but who am I not a critic, just a fan. Give the movie a chance, will ya?", 8/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

memayrinck,"A gem This is a very surprising film. I thought I was hound to be nothing but as always, as always, nothing becomes something when you put it in Robert De Niro's hand. Is there anything this man can't do? Really, from jimmy conway to a retired widower restarting life as an intern. What a gem. And never do you feel sorry for him, há doesn't act like a victim, there's no putty party, he takes it as it comes and does the best out of every situation. A bit sappy but wouldn't we all be better people if we could do the same? The supporting cast is great, I consider Anne Hathaway supporting in this, because it is Mr. De Niro's delightful, intelligent and never ""hamming it up"" performance that makes this nothing into something great. Highly recommend. Keep an eye on him. He never over plays it. What a gentleman.

thejasvi,"On of the best feel good movies for some time. Very rarely do I want a film to be a good hour or two longer, I could spend a whole season and more with Ben and Jules. On the surface it looks like this is going to be an odd romcom vehicle for Hathaway and Dr Niro, but don't let that notion put you off, mainly because it isn't really a romcom, yes there are romances in the film, and this really isn't a spoiler, but ultimately it's a film about a man and woman becoming friends, which is kind of a rare thing in a big budget Hollywood film.

Like many others, I find something kind of annoying about Anne Hathaway, but this was by far my favorite performance from her, I actually started to really like her in this, she was cast perfectly, as was De Niro, the film is a nice reminder of just how strong a character actor he can be and why he's regarded as the best, and Myers has probably created literally the most like-able character ever with Ben, if you don't fall in love with him, then you're a straight up monster.

For me The Intern is a near perfect film, I rarely give 10/10 to anything. Yes it may not be groundbreaking, but in some ways the film is, it eschews the typical expectations from a big budget film like this, and I think only someone like Myers is in a position to do a film like this. At the end of the day, it's literally what a feel good film is, you like all the characters, there isn't a typical antagonist, at least not in human form.

The only real criticism I can give is the casting of Anders Holm, who is a fine dramatic and comedic actor, that anyone who watches Workaholics will adore, but something just didn't feel right with his casting here, maybe it's just that I don't buy him and Anne Hathaway together, despite the fact he kind of looks like her real life husband. It's a slight mis-step to me, and maybe he wasn't the first choice, maybe he got the role after Adam Devine got cast, or vice versa. But it's a very small criticism, because he does the role well, and it hardly detracts from the film as a whole.

makeweight,"Tries to do too much and fails A film that is trying to tell too many stories simultaneously, with the result that none is properly explored, or worse, really makes us care about that much. This is a movie about a retired widower coming back to work as an intern in a hip fashion house and the comedy that arises from his old-school low-tech been-there approach to life and the web-wise younger generation colleagues who think they know it all but really have a lot to learn. And, it's a movie about a woman who's built up from scratch a really successful company but is struggling to create the right balance between work and family, her one-time high-flyer house- husband is playing around, her business funders are concerned about the company's rapid pace of growth, and she's considering big conflict choices between what's best for the business and what's best for the family. It's a film about trust, and the need we all have for someone to whom we can open our hearts, on whom we can lean and depend with total confidence that they will never let us down. And it's a film about love and loss and forgiveness and loving again. Yes, it's all of these things and more, and yet not one of them really takes centre stage, the characters never grow credible in any of these scenarios and plot lines; the whole thing is a jumble.

And it's riddled with absurdities and clichés that remove any hope of believability or realism. Surprise surprise, this hip company turns out to occupy part of the exact same office building that Robert De Niro once used to work in. Coincidence, eh? The ""reward"" massage that first introduces the Rene Russo character to Robert De Niro is, depending on your point of view, either offensive (male teenage fantasies aside, just imagine if the genders were reversed) or totally implausible. The cheating husband is both a casting bloomer and an almost wholly unbelievable character all the way through. The heart-to-heart chat in the hotel room after the fire - so clunky it really struggles. And the ""funders want to bring in a CEO"" plot device! I mean, is there anyone who knows a thing about business who wasn't shouting ""a COO, not a CEO, a COO is what you need"" at the screen?

Could have been great, but really trying to do far too much. And failing.", 6/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

modironak,"Feel Good Factor !! After a long time I saw a movie which is so positive and encourages you to try and materialize your dreams. You have to always keep that hunger for learning alive in you no matter whatever stage you have reached in your life.

During the whole movie I felt so happy and was grinning all the time. Robert De Niro stole the show for me. He looks so genuine and still smart at this age wearing the suits for work which has a start up culture (This makes me realize that Suits always enhance your personality and add a class to your personality). Story Telling and Direction is good and it never bores for a minute.

I would recommend to try this movie as it adds little bit of positive attitude in your life no matter whoever you are.

Amazorg,"Sweet movie with a crucial fault. Since most of the reviews I've seen takes care of the plot, I think I'll have a stand alone opinion in what is wrong in this otherwise super cute movie.

When you use an actor like Anne Hathaway. I mean, maybe one of the most beautiful actresses there is. Alright we know we shouldn't judge by how people look, I am going to do it anyway. Because there is a glaring difference between Jules and her husband, as much as it isn't believable. Alright, people can have their charm, but to have that charm you need to sell it. He didn't sell it at all, I never found him charming or warm, or had any sort of relationship with her. He also cheated on her, which is in fact for many men and women out there is not forgivable. Yet she forgave him for sleeping with some parent in their kid's school within 90 seconds of his pathetic excuse of an apology.

We as viewers don't know this man, all we know he isn't good looking, he cheats, lies, go out of his way to have an affair. How am I as a viewer accept his apology and for her to accept it so easily? We can't! We don't know this man, what makes him special? It is a base for a good story. Sadly the writers got too lazy at the end. 5/10 for ruining something that could be forgiven, if written well.", 5/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

samzzz-69448,"Good on first viewing, but is somewhat predictable The Intern is one of director Nancy Myers' better works in the genre, although not the best. It has its moments of bitter heartbreak, internal conflict, and fairy tale ending, but literally none of these evolve around the title character, but the intern's young female boss, played by Anne Hathaway. If you like her, or appreciate her performance, then you'll like enjoy this film, and vice versa. These emotions ultimately fall just short of inspiring, which is a shame. With more character development and a less predictable plot, perhaps it could have been even better. (Although its reception and box office numbers are still very respectable as things stand).

I imagine Robert De Niro's character was intentionally designed to stick as close to the wise old man/sweet father-figure stereotype as possible, and in De Niro's case with a perma-smile, and it works in this film most of the time.

However, this is also my biggest disappointment with The Intern. De Niro's character is inherently limited for the same reason that it works in the way it does. There is no character arc whatsoever for him in this film. Rene Russo aka his newfound love technically doesn't count, since this little romance subplot was as artificially inserted as they come, and could be seen coming by anyone familiar with the genre from miles away.

De Niro started the movie bored with retirement (this boredom not represented in any meaningful way), and he sees an opportunity to work in a new internet company which happens to be located in the same building where he spent his entire working career (little secret revealed halfway through with no consequence). De Niro's character finishes the movie with a girlfriend (Russo), a new close friend/boss (Hathaway), but how is he a different man than when he started? How is he changed? What has he gone through? Next to none.

One moment provides a glimmer of hope as De Niro and Hathaway engage in a heartfelt exchange in the hotel room on Hathaway's marital situation, a conversation which makes it plain obvious to the audience that we are at least halfway through Act III now, with one big resolution coming up soon to end the story. Disappointingly, Hathaway's crisis practically solves itself in no time (the cheating Hubby confesses his wrongdoing and begs for a second chance, which Hathaway happily accepts, thus giving the happy ending the filmmakers want to give us in a very rushed manner), De Niro is then back to showing the young-lings the wisdoms of life, teaching tai-chi to his boss who has just gone through a private nirvana and was born again. De Niro is the same man in everyway throughout the film.

My other complaint is that the plot twists are all too predictable, or perhaps it's just that I've seen too many similar films and all the usual premises have been done to death in them. The big reveal at the end of Act 1? Turns out the senior intern has a history with the building. The intern is unwanted by the boss, but gradually transforms her opinion of him, even becomes a part of her personal life? This can't be the first film where you've seen a similar plot. The central focus of Act 2? Turns out the boss's home life is far from perfect. How so? A cheating husband, of course. Perhaps I'm complaining too much. Hathaway's performance is stellar, and overall it has been a better than average viewing experience, but I can't see myself wanting to visit this again in future. 6/10 (fresh)", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film reminds you of your grandparents, it reminds you older and younger generations can learn from each other. It reminds you, that we all need someone to catch us when we fall, and it does that while warming your heart then bringing a tear to your eye.

JerzeeGerl,"A likable movie if you just don't expect much This is a very likable, cute and ""feel good"" kind of movie. It's entertaining, just don't expect much. It somehow feels like it could have been better, maybe if the script were a little deeper. Also, the character of Matt (Anne Hathaway's husband)- talk about miscast. He's such a dweeb, you can't even imagine that Anne Hathaway's character would ever be attracted to him to begin with, and yet the irony is that..HE is the one having affair. Anyway, I usually find Anne Hathaway fairly annoying, but I liked her in this, and I loved Robert DeNiro's character, which is basically how every character in this movie feels as well. Well maybe except for Linda Lavin's character lol....", 3/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

He plays the role of a person who has served many years and after his retirement from previous job ,he is bored to death and seeks to work for free as an Intern for a booming e commerce company. Anne Hathaway and De Niro chemistry wins the heart. It is a feel good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars .All the characters are well conceptualized and sketched.This movie also proves that age is not just but a number.

Also, what actually happens in this movie? What is the story? An incredibly calm, good, modern, kind, good looking, healthy old man who knows everything makes an online shopping company better? Where is the conflict?

Let me tell you this I have worked in big corporates and currently working in a start up. People would eat Ben alive.

Overall, it was an unrealistic feel good movie for me.

raccoonongreen,"It depend on your mind. As you get older, your sense of exercise becomes dull, and the relationship between people is diminished. Young people can not understand at all, and the situation that only older people feel is coming at a certain moment.

Looking back, life really went as fast as an arrow.

This film is less realistic, but it seems to have led people to look at retired people from a positive perspective.

Most of the past experiences are no longer needed because of advanced technology, but there may be times when you need a lot of experience and mindfulness at difficult moments. If you have an elderly senior when a difficult situation is happening, will not it be a bad thing?

I feel my heart warming throughout the movie.

josharekare,"Nice enough *** Thematic spoilers***

Yes, Robert De Niro is terrific. And that is expected, too. Nothing new there. Also Anne Hathaway is a wonderful actress. Together they are capable of tremendous work. But 'The Intern' aims for much less.

It isn't a bad movie, it is very nice and warm in fact. It took me a while to understand the bar it set itself and once I reconciled my expectations with that bar, I was happy with it. I loved the contrivances and found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, too.

But I'm still cognisant of the possibilities. For one, I really really wish Ben Whittaker wasn't a flawless star. He is a seventy year old white man with years of experience running a company. To write the character to be one without any biases (not the objectionable ones at least) or foibles is taking a very simple route. Not just Ben, every one in the movie is sweet, nice, and harmless to the point of being cloying.

Like I said, The Intern doesn't aim too high but I wished there was a little more drama in the proceedings. I wish at least one of the leads would make mistakes, or a situation transpires where tough decisions need to be taken but nothing of that sort occurs.

But even without these elements, it is a great watch for the performances, and the humour, and the smooth direction. And I really liked a point or two that the movie made. Being a 25 year old male, I didn't exactly understand the feminist standpoint initially but it made sense to me later and I appreciated the fact that the movie made me think about it. I can't say much more without giving away the plot but you can try the movie yourself and appreciate what I'm talking about.", 9/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

bigstickgreg,"A Wonderfully Written and Acted Feel-Good Movie I really enjoyed this movie. The characters were believable real-life people while the theme was light and heartwarming. If you work in the tech industry like I do, you'll appreciate the pros and cons of owning your own tech business and the employee's that you'll need to hire. Mr. DeNiro was exceptional with his acting skills in this flick. He was sincere, steady, and strong in this role as an Intern providing life's experience to a young start-up mom. Ms. Hathaway was also exceptional in this role as I watched her going through the emotional trauma of owning your own business and keeping one's relationship, with husband and daughter, in tact. There were a couple moments where I had a tear in my eye as I could relate to both as an older adult. The funny parts were not overdone and brought a smile to my face. I would recommend this movie for all ages. It's the best movie I've seen this year (2016).

imdb-6252,"Mildly entertaining, but zero on the believability index I'm the weird movie watcher. I can watch a movie with a premise that is not totally believable, but certain things can spoil the fantasy we're supposed to believe instantly.

For me, this happened almost instantly where we're taken to this bustling Brooklyn e-commerce business with hundreds of employees at their desk answering calls and looking at email. All on banks and banks of spanking new, perfectly aligned Macs. Come on! Is there a company anywhere on planet earth of this size that would be using Macs like this? Every desktop, every laptop has the Apple logo. When Apple got this opportunity, they must have seriously soiled themselves at the opportunity to have the big screen filled with their products. Have you EVER heard the term ""Let's Netflix a movie tonight""? Little things like this really take me out of the fantasy of a movie.

Otherwise, the movie is kind of cute. The premise of having to break into the mom's house made me think ""Oh... one of those stupid, would never happen in a million years type movies."". You've got a guy like Ben that is supposed to be all proper, dresses well, speaks well, has an immaculate house, and has the proper answer for everything is all of the sudden breaking into mom's house with a bunch of unlikable zit- faced kids. For a 2 hour plus movie, that scene should definitely have been removed.

Lastly, casting, is there anyone that believes a woman like Jules would have a husband like Matt? Anyone? Neat and proper Jules married to a schmo like him? Not believable.

All in all, I'd say I endured this movie. I hated a few things, but DeNiro and Hathaway salvaged an otherwise poorly executed story.", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

wearethefirstandlastnight,"I didn't care for this film -- -- not due to its technical strengths. The story in three acts is well structured and filmed much like the romantic comedies of 1990-99. What I DIDN'T like about is was, a smart, together business woman -- forming and leading her own successful corporation in New York City -- still relies on the intelligence and wisdom of the elder male. A bit too paternal for my tastes in that way. The relationship between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro is tender, sweet -- there is good chemistry there. It would have been interesting and perhaps more topical to EXCHANGE these roles -- watch the impact of the rise of modern feminism depicted in the characters.

aserpentperplexed,"Well Acted Movie Bogged Down by Clichés Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie. It's a cute movie about growing old, marriage, and balancing work life with family. It was well acted by DeNiro and Hathaway, and the remaining cast also played their roles well. You laugh, you cry, etc. This movie's cast and writing team alone easily could have earned this a 9/10. But unfortunately while the premise is interesting and the execution is good, by the third act it falls into quite a few clichés and sappy resolutions. If you're not familiar with the genres of the retirement story or the work life balance movie, you'll probably give it an 8 or 9 out of 10. If you are familiar though, the third act will have you rolling your eyes constantly. In particular, there is a climactic scene in which a character who did something very bad gives an apologetic speech to Hathaway. The film earlier built up that this character deserves little respect for what they did, but without even so much as a scolding or a look of anger, the character gives his little apology and receives tearful instant forgiveness to the sound of sappy music. Which reminds me: while the plot got cliché about two thirds of the way into the movie, the MUSIC was cliché throughout. Completely uninspired sappy elevator music typical of this type of movie. But neither of these really made me hate the movie overall, hence I still gave it a rating of 7/10.", 8/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

alexwebb32,"A lot of good You can tell that this is the same director that did The Holiday - it's got the same magic. Which is why I'm giving it 7 stars. Made me laugh and cry. Good script, though I do feel that the film tries to do more than it has time for. With so much to get through, there are important relationships and characters that the film doesn't have time to make us become invested in.

Perfect casting of the leads. Hathaway and especially De Niro were perfect. Anders Holm, however, was a let down - such an important role to get right, but what we got was a husband with no personality and dead eyes. The ending didn't have the same impact because of this.

I also have to point out the awkward cinematography. I don't know if the DoP or director is to blame, it's weird because they both have great films under their belts. I had to pause the film several times and just stare in amazement at how bad some of the shots were. There were adequate shots, but none that stood out as great.

Finally, I wish the same effort had been put into the score as was put into The Holiday's score.", 5/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

kajalrani,"Interesting Internship I have been meaning to see this movie since it was released and finally I watched it and it was worth it. The story line is so different. Its so simply and elegantly portrays the life of old people and need of change for them, providing opportunities to them, crediting them for their experience. Its teaches you to be open to change, explore the world but also at the same time be yourself. ""Grey is the new Green"", very well said. I mean the things Ben said, how he dealt with everything was just a phenomenal example to us on how to handle certain situation. The light comedy, and the essence of changing technological world brings life to the movie. One ore thing it teaches you is to have hope, belief in you. Situations change, things become more complex, tension starts to build up but all you need is to have a me time and also talk to the one whom you can trust and who understands and then provides you with an honest and wise advise. Silence speaks for itself and those silent moments in the movie give it a touch of reality. Loved it...

I also enjoyed his etiquette which he shared with the young men who were his co-workers. I felt that if Emily Post had a brother, it would be Ben Whittaker. Since the first time I saw this film I've watched it at least 5 more times. Thank you to the cast, crew and their families for making this film possible.

nmin-34951,"Stores Nothing Great - if you have nothing to do this Weekend then it's a good option to go for. Movie Review - The Intern - Stores Nothing Great Nancy Meyers has an old hand in making upper middle-age rom-com but this time she casually breezed into seniorities with her latest make 'The Intern'. It's a collage of lighthearted merriment packed with mature actors. The movie is based on cross-generation rendezvous. The movie consists stars like Di Niro and Anne Hathaway, yet it retains the affable tone of Meyer with upper-middle ambiance dedicated the well spruce homes.

The movie embarks with a promise. Ben Whittaker (Robert Di Niro) a 70-year-old widower, applies for a senior internship in an exuberant online fashion retail company held by a very assiduous micro-manger Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway).The movie has nothing new to showcase, it's just like Meyers previous flicks but with a tint of cross-generation element. Both the actors did justice to the role but it's the story which laids back the movie. Anne Hathaway is quite convincing and looks gorgeous as always. Audience from all genres won't like the movie and if you have nothing to do this weekend then it's a good option to go for. http://www.bollywoodgupshup.net/movie-review-the-intern/", 10/10,"4 out of 12 found this helpful.

anda-alexandra-86,"How People Still Have Music In Them As long as one has music in himself, in his soul, one cannot help playing. It is true, instrument players - professional players - do not retire. They live on their life's by making music everyday. It does not matter that they no longer do it on the stage, in front of people. They may give lessons for further generations but they never quit, they never drop their instrument once they retire. Music flows through their veins and it is a part of whom they are. They stop only when there is no more music in them. If there is one thing, for sure, that I will keep with myself after watching the movie The Intern, is the fact that we can always do something with our life, no matter the age, if you believe in yourself - you are kind - and you still ""have music in you"".

I have watched the newly released movie, The Intern, at the beginning of this month at Cinema City in Kazimierz, with a dear sweet friend of mine. Some may name it a ""chick flick"" movie just because the main character is a lady running - successfully, if I may add - it's own company. Let me mark that down: an online shopping site that grew from a one lady - show to 200 employees. As Jules, the leading character played by the Oscar winner Anne Hathaway, was stating right in the middle of the movie, you cannot name a site sexist / feminist / chick's site just by generalizing the fact that only women buy online! Same goes for chick flick movie status! I think it is a lovely comedy with 2 amazing actors that are terribly and wonderfully old-school: Anne Hathaway (Jules) & Robert de Niro (Ben). *** I was surprised and saddened that they both were not the first choices for the part. The chemistry that they have on & off screen is lovely. You can see throughout the interviews the respect that they have for one another. The storyline is simple: Jules is a rising manager with a company in Brooklyn. She owns an Internet page for online shopping. Overall headcount of the company = 200 employees = a log of department and a lot of fuss for Jules. It was quite funny and sad at the same time seeing her ride the bike in the office (instead of walking) just to save time... The growth of the company makes people believe that they need a director to manage the things and keep Jules on the creative side. The issue is that this might not be what Jules wants nor needs.

What I loved about this movie: - the actuality of it - I felt for Ben when he was trying to open up the Mac for the first time... I am extremely proud to say that my mum and granny both have smart-phones and tablets. They have their very own Facebook accounts that they use on a daily basis - both for fun/ pleasure but also for keeping in touch with me and my sister, as we live abroad. I know how hard it is for people to change from one system to another. But I was told that precisely this is what keeps the brain alive :) - the somewhat - continuity of Ben's job - I loved Ben's connection with the old Brooklyn brick house where Jules 's company is currently residing. Ben used to work in the same building for several dozen if years, until he retired - they used to do phone books there. He knows every nook of the place and now he has come back to it. It must feel very much like home... - Ben's old fashioned way of being - I love the old school chivalry, when men would escorted women, open the door for them, bring them flowers and smile delicately. There is a scene I really love when Ben explains why men carry around with themselves handkerchiefs. They never use them themselves so why do they bother? The handkerchiefs are carried for the ladies, in case they would need help - the delicate sex will always cry at a sentimental movie, for example :) I also love the scene where we get to see Ben's house, and especially his wardrobe - spotless and neatly arranged, with drawers and hangers that display all items. The way he chooses his wardrobe each evening and prepares it for the next day... people don't do that anymore! - the difference between men and boys - or the difference between Ben and all his other colleges that have no clue what style is, even though they work in the fashion online environment. Wear s shirt, tuck it in, use a tie! Those are some of the things that Ben teaches them ;) even Jules asks the question that for a long while was in my mind as well: ""where are the men now-days?"" where are the men like Cary Grant or Harrison Ford? And why are we breeding only ""boys""? Sad, but true, isn't it?", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

linda-price95,"Predictable, Sappy, Corny, Loved It! This movie was very predictable, very sappy and corny and I loved every minute of it. I'm a Robert Dinero fan and enjoyed him in this role as well as Anne Hathaway. I was pleased that Anne Hathaway's character was in charge of her own company, however wasn't a ""B"". It didn't have any other well known actors (at least not known to me) but other than the two stars and Linda Lavin from Alice & Rene Russo, I didn't recognize any of the other actors. If you want to go see a movie and feel good afterwards, this is the one for you. The average age of the audience when I attended was about 60. I went early in the day, so most of the viewers were probably retired like me. If you're under 30, I don't think this is the movie for you.

Don't expect any earth shattering climaxes, don't want to spoil anything but like I said previously, the movie is predictable.

shaifalihere,"Ben, a 70-year old intern is a personal beck-and-call person to his 28-year old female boss. The Intern fails on its 'experience never gets old' tagline

The movie, with ""Experience never gets old"" plastered in huge bold capital letters on the posters - forgets the story line some 10 minutes into the movie.

A 70-year old man, played by Robert De Niro bored of retirement, applies for an internship programme to have more and something new to do in life. And thus he enters into the life of some 200 20- something employees and their female boss, played by Anne Hathaway, at an e-commerce fashion company.

There, he supports his 28-year old female boss tackle professional, social, and personal problems that come with cracking the glass-ceiling, becomes a personal driver to the boss, and acts as an agony- uncle to young co-workers.

Hathaway's character Jules is the main story - and how Ben's years of life and business experience is exactly what she needs to tackle her problems. He helps and helps, and gives away half a dozen of handkerchiefs to crying ladies in the film which tried to be feminist.

Ben came across as being used by the younger generation in the movie. Though he applied for the internship voluntarily, he ended up doing more work than the paid employees around - - thanks to his years of business knowledge, and his nature of wanting to be of use (he cleaned a messy table - without being asked - playing the typical role of an unpaid intern in real life!) He also becomes a personal beck-and-call person to Jules. At the end of the film, he takes a day off to get back to a yoga session with his retired mates who are previously shown very early in the film when he is planning to do something more interesting! Clearly, the internship has nothing much to give to him in return, except, of course, a female masseuse as a friend.

If you went to watch the film to see it make some kind of statement on life and motivation, if one is ever too old to work, and whether there is a limit to learning, you will find none of this here. Essentially, the movie remains a misplaced, mis- promoted film.", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

imposierosie,"A light hearted movie. Definitely an easy watch. This film is not one that is pushing any boundaries or trying to be an award winning film, it is what is says on the tin, a light hearted, easy to watch film. It provides numerous laughs and you identify enough with the characters to care what happens to them. You want Robert de Niro to feel like he has something worthwhile to get up for everyday and you want Anne Hathaway to make the right choice both about her business and her family. And at the end, you feel satisfied that both characters have achieved these things. De Niro and Hathaway give good performances as do the other actors in the film. The plot is pretty good with some small twists and turns along the way. Overall, the film delivers what is promises and it's a enjoyable to watch too.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

How many people do you know like that in real life?. And Anne Hathaway's daughter is just as sweet as can be. Yuck! I'm suck of that in movies. To me, it's lazy writing.

I read about the movie, and I liked the idea & the fact that De Nero & Hathaway are both in it... I wanted an escape from the usual action fiesta... so I picked The Intern and watched it... It is one of the rare movies which gave me a real good feeling and positive energy... I enjoyed Ben's character, his congeniality, wisdom, and the positive influence, and how he positively affect all around him, even the dynamic Jules, although he's the older generation... Since then, I've seen it more than once, and I'll keep watching it from time to time...

ben_all_mighty,"Great film for the family inc seniors :-) What a great film, De Nerio give a great performance paying Ben a retired widower who still has life and wants to live it. Coming into a 21st Century tech industry with a 20th Century attitude he becomes a part of the company. Hathaway also give a touching performance as the company owner who fighting her own battle as a working mum with pressure of her business expanding resents Ben at first, but learns over the film what matters most. There are lots of underlying story lines through the film that work and bring the story to a pleasant end inc a Generational friendship, almost father daughter between De Nerio and Hathaway as well as inter company relations touching on some of the subjects foiling industry today. The film is well written and should be likes by all. I think as a 21th Century adult I see allot of my Grandparents in De Nerio's character the film, with them just getting an iPad last year, I had to help them set up on facebook and the internet. What once seemed like an impossible mission has become a reality and they now spend more time surfing the web then I do. The film is also filled with great laugh out loud moments that touch home. I think it's a film for the family inc your seniors.", 10/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

audacious1,"A Show For the Ages and the Differences Between Them This movie does not have a complicated story line. A widower is bored with retirement and gets a job as an intern at an online clothing supplier. Because he is a class act, people begin to trust him and love him. He teaches them another perspective about life.

The story is nothing new or fantastic, but it is presented in a fun, humorous manner that draws you into the story (unless you are heartless and uncaring). The chemistry between the major characters works well. The most awkward character is the young intern, Davis. His personality seems to be undecided and incomplete, so he appears awkward. You can't be sure if he is exuberant and gay (unsure), or if he is just exuberant. The actor playing the role goes with it and makes the most out of very little.

The roles of Becky and Cameron are given more depth, yet, still one dimensional, really. They are fun to watch, but all the depth of the movie is shared between De Niro and Hathaway, with the exception of the husband. He gets his moments to show depth as well.

I didn't go to this movie looking for Oscar winning roles, script, or direction. De Niro is solid in his portrayal of this likable old man, and Hathaway displays her versatility by playing a fragile, successful woman, but I'd be surprised to find an Oscar nomination tossed their way. The script just doesn't go that deep. If I had one complaint, that would be it. The script teases us with bits of information, enough for us to care about the characters, but that is all. The movie is close to two hours long. That could be a reason the script seems trimmed.

Going to this movie is not about viewing some great achievement, it's about enjoying yourself for an afternoon (that's when I went). I saw no unhappy, critical faces leaving the theater. Sadly, most of the movie's patrons were middle-aged or seniors. This movie deserves a wider audience because its overall purpose is to entertain by examining, humorously, the differences in generations, and it does a great job of it.", 7/10,"1 out of 4 found this helpful.

ro-rao2007,"Had potential but did not deliver It's not every day that one comes across a movie like The Intern. The concept of senior citizens opting to come out of retirement and reboot their careers is a fresh one, which is what the movie centers on. The movie also boasts of having 2 reputable actors to its name, Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. So it can be said that the movie was all set up to be a memorable experience.

However, somewhere along the way it stumbles miserably in its execution.

Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower, who decides that he's had enough of the lifestyle of a retiree, and opts to refresh his career when he comes across an opportunity to work as a senior citizen in a growing online fashion startup. This entire sequence of events takes place in the first 5-10 minutes of the movie. He eventually applies and gets in with ease, which takes place in another 5-10 minutes of the movie. No problems there. He is eager to learn and has adjusted comfortably to the 21st century, except he dresses in an old-fashioned manner, which his colleagues initially make light of.

So where's the conflict?

Anne Hathaway plays Jules Ostin, a twenty-something CEO of a rising online fashion startup. She is entirely career-driven, which takes a toll on her relationships with her family and even with her employees. We see the career-driven side of Jules, but we are basically just told everything we need to know about her in about 5-10 minutes. We don't really get much exposure to her back-story, which would have really strengthened the character.

This, again, weakens the point of conflict in the story and the character development.

If the issue with actually developing the characters and slowing down the pace of the movie was risking making the movie over 2 hours in length, then it would have been better to cut out the number of issues to address and instead focus on 2-3 main plot points. This would have made it easier for us to empathize with the characters and the situations they found themselves in.

As I said before, however, the casting directors were on point, as I found the performances to be the one main strength of the movie. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway were cast perfectly as Ben and Jules, respectively, and I could not have imagined anyone else who would have done the roles justice. The two seem to ease into their roles without much difficulty and give natural, sincere performances.

Overall, The Intern was backed by a fresh, novel concept and strong performances. But what it struggled with was a rushed execution and the need for the writers to jam in and address an unnecessarily large number of 21st century issues. It would have been more effective for the movie to instead focus on 2-3 core plot points.", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

This movie has all the ingredients in the right proportion sans sex and violence. Not mushy type though.

Great story rendered with great fineness. Admired wonderful acting by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. JoJo Kushner is simply adorable.

Here is a film, a fiction, that you can believe it to be true.

Amazing to see how flawlessly the story has been woven. Inter action of people of two different generations has been so nicely depicted.

Impressive ways to highlight the good of two different generations. Highlighting the good of each not disrespecting the other.

One more movie to be added in my personal collection for worth keeping it for long time.

talha-jawed21,"Robert De Niro pulls it off like no one else ever could, but the story leaves something to be desired Robert De Niro taking the role of the modern day Uncle Iroh is something that everyone needs, a supportive wise guide to help you deal with the stresses of life. The storyline and set up is good too, but the movie leaves a lot to be desired in terms of a story, it feels as if there was almost no conclusion to the story, little internal/external conflict. Sure, there were some conflicts but there was no real objective or plot that the movie moved towards, almost as if it was a filler episode in a sitcom, it severely lacked a sense of substance and direction. To be honest, the movie was very moving and touching but left me feeling as if the story wasn't complete.

shritanvarma,"Great Chemistry and some good humour make it a fuzzy experience SHORT REVIEW- RATING - 3.5/5

Nancy Meyers' latest flick is satisfying and very funny. Robert DeNiro and Anne Hathaway have great chemistry which is the main plus point for the movie. It doesn't rely on slapstick humour and actually gives some good clean jokes. the scene where they break into Jules' mom's house if hilarious and the dialogue is pretty commendable. However, in the final act, there is a twist which almost ruins the fun of the movie and the movie takes a much more emotional toll.

+ Great Chemistry + Good Humour + Fast pace - Third Act's small twist - Tonal changes towards the end - unnecessary love track between DeNiro and Russo", 8/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

exofanforever101,"Sweetest Movie Ever Seen!! I must start off this review by saying that this is by far the cutest real life movie I have ever seen! Robert De Niro plays such a kind character who is so wise and helpful in every way possible. And Anne Hathaway was a brilliant CEO who portrays a woman of strength and power. However, this also movie shows the flip side of having a powerful woman running a business and not having much time for her husband.

Ben (Robert De Niro) helps Jules (Anne Hathaway) not only with the company but also with her personal life and shows Jules that she can be a powerful CEO of a company without having to lose her position for her husband. He also manages to help almost everyone he meets! He is generally a very lovable character.

This movie is a must watch for anyone who wants an easy, relaxing and heart warming plot.", 1/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Anne Hathaway was back to her devil wears prada role which I love her for.

I never expected for Robert Deniro to be funny but he definitely was. This was a real comedy and I have not seen a real comedy like this in a long time, and a real comedy meaning its just more and more laughter. There is a little bit of like romance in it but most comedies these days have romance in them. Most of all Anne Hathaway was great as well. There are a lot of well known faces that you will see and there all great. So anybody who doubts this movie please go rent it or whatever and you will not be disappointed I can promise you that. Take it from me because if I'm writing an actual review then it had to be really good because I don't do this normally.

Paradoxical_Perceiver,"Fabulous take on many things all together. An old-school retired executive meets a new-age Tech CEO and both the world's come together gracefully, learning from eachother, appreciating and complimenting eachother. Robert De Niro is an absolute charm and it appears he didn't even had to adapt a single trait to play this character. He is just made for it. Anne Hathaway from being an intern turn close associate in her early days to being the CEO herself. Wow! Anne Hathaway carried the whole role so enigmatically. A modern age woman who is ambitious and balances her work life, her family time, her employees and her relationship with everyone. The support cast was good aswell, a few bits more in 5-10 mins extra screentime would have been great. Despite being beautiful in her simplicity, a few more fashionista montages of Anne Hathaway purely as fan service or for people who have massive crush on her, would have been the cherry on the cake. The overall chemistry of the characters especially the lead stars was amazing, the character development was top-notch especially from Anne's character perspective, a few scenes of Robert's character taking up the modern take, wearing Tshirt to the office, listening to modern music would have added a little more shine. Overall a great experience. Worth the time. People should watch it for the fun of it.", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Screenrights,"I loved it. I read the first dozen or so reviews and most were negative; wrongly so in my opinion. I wonder if the writers of those negative reviews failed to understand the purpose of the film and wrote subjective, rather than objective, critiques from a clichéd masculine and born of youth inexperienced standpoint. I enjoyed the film immensely as indeed I enjoyed the screenplay. I suspect that some reviewers failed to realise that the entire film is intended to be seen from the point of view of a seventy year old man with a lifetime of experience that those younger reviewers completely fail to comprehend, let alone understand. Watch it and enjoy it and push negativity out of your life. Robert De Nero and Anne Hathaway are consummate in their performances.

The screenplay is without any loopholes, the story is good, and the acting is stunning. Robert De Niro is a great actor, and this movie shows he hasn't lost his touch. Anne Hathway is the perfect business woman, and I feel nobody else could do the job so well done. This movie has everything for comedy lovers and the serious watchers. Sometimes it gets emotional, but most of the times its funny and relaxing. The director has also done a great job. The movie has a nice soundtrack, and the locations are also cool.

The movie introduced a number of interesting characters for whom we developed a semblance of care and connection, but ended the film without following any of them to some logical conclusion.

The relationships being developed by the assistant, the masseuse, the chauffeur, the young intern were all ripe for development, but left the viewers hanging. The facial expressions of the audience on the way out of the theater confirmed the fact that the movie ended too soon.

bryandn321,"A Incredible breath of fresh air! Suitable to watch for many occasions! First off I wanted to start by saying this movies genre is not the typical type I usually lean towards. When it comes to Hathaway movies Love & Other Drugs is the first one that comes to mind as a favorite. Anyways being a big movie watcher. On I have always rated watched movies & TV shows but up until recently have never left written reviews. Well being a big fan of both Hathaway and DeNiro. I was surprised in 2020 that I had not seen this movie.

Sometimes when I'm having trouble finding something to watch, one way I find something is I will look up one of my favorite actresses or actor and watch a movie starring them. Now it was a bonus finding a movie relating to the genre I needed to watch. With all the cruel people I have been forced to deal with lately it felt good watching ""The Intern"". The chemistry that DeNiro & Hathaway bring to the screen is a breath of fresh air!

Loved the plot and how even though this is a work of fiction. I just love how DeNiro uses many now obsolete norms of the past in a modern hipster style tech setting. I think this movie would be a good pick to watch on nearly any occasion. If you have a partner or children who stare at their cellphone screens like robots this is a must watch. If you want some pointers on how to be a gentleman this is a must watch. If your just looking for a feel good movie this is a must watch. Well I hope this was some help.

marvinandujar,"Good Sunday Movie Plot: I think this movie is good to watch while you feel lazy and would like to watch something laid back. Although, I expected better comedy in the movie. I think there are a lot of funny situations that could have been created for this movie. Now, the idea of a woman be the CEO of a company while her husband stays at home is pretty good as there is a big movement for equality at work between women and men. The movie should have shown more on how she created her company and became CEO. Also, more interaction in the conflicts the CEO experience with stay at home moms. This would show more the problem with stereotypes and old school mentality vs new school.

Acting: I think the acting is pretty good. Of course, the main actors are Oscars winners with a lot of experience.

Overall: It is an OK movie where it could have been better in many ways as aforementioned. I hope main actors get to do another and more serious movie.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

It's not quite a rom-com. I would describe it more as a feel-good movie.

The production quality was great. The lighting and cinematography was appropriate and the costumes and set design was amazing.

The story was really well written and the cast really stepped up to the plate. The directing was obviously great, as all the actors totally became their characters.

You could identify with the story and it was funny. It was also incredibly sad at times and I even cried with the characters, but there was definitely more laughter and you walk away from the movie with some hope for the human race in general.

shekharkalra1211,"De Niro is so damn Adorable! Loved it 'The Intern' is just the perfect go-to feel-goody movie that might just lighten up your day, along with some subtle sweet relatable things to take home to.

Ben Whittaker, our perfect gentleman, saying the right things, doing the right things, in his 71st year, does inspire a lot; but sometimes too idealistic for my taste. Though sometimes, it doesn't hurt seeing a perfect mentor to our ever-so-stressed Jules. Ben's perfection, maturity and finesse in handling things actually allows the film to focus more on the Jules' plotline, adding little to his own character arc, which might iritate some, just barely.

The humor is just adequate, not slapstick, just subtle chuckle-humor, perfectly complementing the lightheadedness of this flick.

alexfath,"Disguised political correctness A praise to women emancipation castrating men into beta males who play life-roles like mother and are emotionally immature and unbalanced. De Niro represents the old school of men already dying and giving place to the new hipster metro-sexual boys. Hathaway plays an alpha-woman role very sensitive but neurotic too.

This is a political correctness film, very well disguised by tenderness and pseudo-drama. Typical of Hollywood modern films undermining the traditional roles of sexes in the western world.

The only plus of the film was De Niro. Calm and balanced. Self-confident, wise and experienced.

siamakvahed,"You cannot fix a lopsided table by turning it around! There are many reasons to use the word 'shallow' to describe a film, but I will use it for a straightforward reason. If something is wrong, you cannot make exceptions unless you give a legit reason for it; otherwise, all you do is what this film does: you turn the problem around and end up where you started, only with the toppings of 'niceness' and 'feel-goodness'.

This film shows the practice of reversing traditional position of man and woman, and when it encounters the same old problems, it simply changes the narrative. This way, something that was wrong before now is just, because the one doing it is a different person.

The stay-at-home man nags about her spouse putting her work first, complains about her not spending enough time with the family, and cheats (of course, a classic move, right!?). But the film insists that it is not in any way the workaholic wife's fault for not paying enough attention to her husband and their daughter. On the other hand, the woman is convinced by this narrative that she should not consider any adjustments on her side because this is all on him.

To put it short, it is clear that nobody likes and wants the 'stay-at-home' job, at least not in this format, just like nobody wants to be an 'employee.' But it is impossible to make everybody an employer; it defeats the whole purpose of the employer-employee structure. Then what is to be done? The answer is simple and, at the same time, may sound fantastical to some: fix the unequal legs of the table instead of turning it around.", 7/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

microwavedenny,"A beautiful feel good and inspiring movie I am writing this review while my feelings about this movie remains fresh and warm. And boy it makes you feel so positive and so good even if you are not in your best of spirits as I was quite ill while i saw this. The scenes are utmost beautiful, the acting captivating and there are quite some messages that are being thrown out to our generation.

First out, I was not a particular fan of Robert De Niro till now, my ignorance obviously, but he literally blew me away with his screen presence and subtle expressions. There is unarguably no one in this whole world who could have done better justice to this role as he has. He is an epitome of being a gentleman- one who says the right things at the right times - and through him the film shows what experience brings to the table. Even the trifle things he does affects you like for example being compelled to tuck in your shirts all the time or carry around a crisply folded hanky, so on and so forth .His expressions are so self explanatory and transparent and it truly demonstrates what a fine artist he is.

Anne Hathaway shines in every way. I wondered why their faces or why their ears blushed red all the time when the emotions were high. And i believe it is the commitment and the warmth that comes when the actors are living and not acting the moments. She addresses issues such as sexism feminism and a working woman's quandary over pursuing your dreams or compromising them for your family, just to name few , with ease. The other cast were equally superb and everyone deserves a mention. Special mention also goes out to the captivating cinematography the casting and the perfectly blending background scores. A complete package in every technical area that one could never find fault in.

Overall I would highly recommend it to anyone; as this film is a true to life film that sticks to its theme always, one that is more beautiful than its cast , that leaves you with a smile, and most importantly one that makes you write your first film review.", 8/10,"1 out of 2 found this helpful.

jwparis-40037,"Great Movie I absolutely loved this movie! Here are my reasons why

1. It is such a sweet movie about finding friends you never expected to have and still having life left in you. It shows you the balance of life in such a different way and view and that you can do anything no matter your age or gender. It shows that running your own business can be difficult at times but you have friends and family to support you along the way.

2. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway give a great performance to this movie because of their great acting skills and connection towards their characters friendship. Throughout the movie you see their friendship grow into family. I thought that Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro really stepped it up in terms of engaging with their characters and making it look believable.

3. There are so many twists and surprises along the way that you never thought could happen. I thought Nancy Meyers ( directer and writer) wrote an incredibly entertaining movie and directed it very well. If I could watch this over and over again I would because it is so incredibly entertaining, truthful and sweet.

So there you have it one of the best movies I have ever watched!", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

kingrich-19066,"This film is mostly alright I knew very little about this film going in, but found it to be a decent enough film with decent enough acting and a decent enough plot.

There's some lightly humourous moments throughout with many, obviously, planted in the generational divide. It does contain some quite well-delivered sympathetic moments as well.

One of my favourite parts was the recommendation to always carry a handkerchief with you in case someone needs it as I live to a similar code.

I would have liked one or two more scenes with Rene Russo and i think it could have done without the 'cheating' plot line. I was honesty marvelling at it being a rare film without some form of bad guy up to that point. It would have been quite refreshing and would have earned a seven from me otherwise.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

larrynabilfathy,"Nice and nicely done. A retired widower, Ben, starts a new job as an intern in an online fashion retailer company run by, Jules, the workaholic super committed young lady.

The two of them get encountered as Ben becomes Jules's personal intern. Following his looks and the way he dressed, Jules thought Ben can't offer much nether to her, nor to her company. So, she gave him the least amount of tasks.

Surprisingly he catches her attention after he managed to voluntarily arrange a disk that has been always found unarranged. Subsequently, Ben becomes her right hand who is responsible for each aspect of her life, starting from getting her daughter to and from school, to breaking into her mother's house to delete an email sent to her by mistake from Jules.

Eventually, his guidance helps her bringing her life together. It's a nice drama/light movie about starting over, and how people could do more regardless their age or problems. However, the journey for Ben, the leading role wasn't much of a struggle. Which brings us to wonder, whose story it was? Ben, or Jules's?

Ben didn't do much to blend in, while the effort Jules had to do to amend her marriage, sort things out in her company, and bringing her life together was much in comparison to the challenges Ben went through.

He didn't fail, not even once in any of his tasks. He drew a line of wisdom, comfort, and trust through the whole movie, yet, it was a bit difficult to believe. Especially, when he mentioned at the beginning of the movie that he used to call his grandson to ask him what the heck is a USB, but we see him smoothly using a laptop, doing emails, and he even changed from an old SAMSUNG to an iPhone with no much of a struggle.

It's a nice movie indeed, that drew a smile and a relief following the happy ending.", 3/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

laurenc-34028,"Enjoyed it! My husband and I just saw this movie and went in having read some reviews here thinking it might not be so good, but we REALLY enjoyed it!! So I am purposely coming back to review this movie positively with that in mind.

Great chemistry between the two main characters and cleaver concept of a storyline of a senior intern working for a young business founder. We found it pretty realistic about the fast pace of today's businesses and the conceived value of a younger workforce that understands technology and a fast and exorbitant work pace, with the older generation's experience being taken for granted. And enjoyed a nice exploration of the two generations' approach to work style and how the old and new can work together and build off of each other. Two thumbs up from us!

vaidivad,"Nice film. Maybe this movie is not one of the greats, but it's quite funny, I think is very nice film. Robert give us a good performance as usual, with a excellent combination with Ann, with a fantastic result which deliver us an acceptable comedy film. Sometimes the actors' performance is not precisely convincing, but at the end, story yes it is, forceful. Robert gave us an charming performance a bit difficult to believe, because we are not used to seeing him with this kind of roles, but he did marvelous as a great actor as he is. In contrast, we are used to seeing to Ann in this sort of films but in this case, not in the main role as comedy actress, rather as a dramatic actress in certain manner.

pfroats,"not something I do every day I have been to see this film at the theatres twice now. that doesn't happen often. I can truthfully say that this is one of the best films that I have seen Robert DeNiro in and Anne Hathaway gives a great performance as well.

Both my wife and myself left the theatre thinking that this was perhaps the best movie we have seen all year. It goes to show that you CAN produce a movie without the gratuitous swearing and sex and still come out with a product that will entice viewers to want to see it and in all likelihood purchase it when it comes out on video. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone as a feel good viewing choice along the lines of a blind side, pretty woman or nottinghill.

yehanchaa,"It touches almost every aspect of someone's life. We are working in a busy world with busy lives. Even we don't know 100% what is going on with our lives anymore.

This is a good movie which tells us that we should balance the work and life and also we should not take quick decisions thinking that they will make everything better than what it is now. It also reminds that what our old people knows about the work and life is really far away from what we think they know.

It can be a Drama or Comedy but the abstract information it gives us spreads all over ones life; working, parenting, entrepreneurship, family, friends, passion, sacrificing and many more.

shubham7384,"Loved De Niro's character more than movie The Intern is entirely a sweet plot with some more sugar of Ben(De Niro). I liked its character more than its plot spcly the lead. Anne has done a great work in it and relationship between then is just awesome. Ben is a character whom we all want to be in our real life , A loved one who knows what to say and do in the right spot. Though there are some plot holes but its all right. I decided to watch the movie just because of Hathway but when i finished i loved De Niro more in the movie.

koconnor-188-558535,"crinkly charm i liked ""intern"" and i can be a harsh critic at times but listening to the script and focusing on some detail do give this flick an interesting edge. Being old myself and retired (55) i can relate to the need to keep occupied and use my time well ,De Niro's character reflected those issues well by his routine and habits and genuine excitement at the prospect of being back in the roller coaster world of work. Ben has nothing to prove and is secure but obviously lonely and feels isolated ,even though he does have some unwanted attention..De Niro sets a nice tone with his well proved facial expressions and gradually becomes liked by his colleagues.the first few scenes convey the uncertainty of the young staff with an older person present.i think there is a message in this re culture and our need to keep moving on, forgetting the benefits of experience and old age ,doesn't just mean drooling and demise . The relationships Ben has with his colleagues is touching and meaningful ,leading to the advice that would otherwise be unavailable and the young staffs reliance on media for conversation and communication is challenged ! Hopefully, humans will not forget to speak one to one? Hathaway is slightly manic but absorbing and dedicated as a focused entrepreneur should be . The touches of emotion under pressure were presented well. Funny moments were regular,highly amusing but not frequent enough .. but is new york devoid of black folk ,i think not ,so maybe in the casting should have chosen more wisely ,as black faces were few and generally in the background?.for such a low budget of 40m ""intern"" is watchable and moving and worth a punt,but don't expect visual mayhem just a gentle ride with moments of humour and charm?", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

pynchonv-89350,"Not exactly compelling You keep expecting something to happen. And sometimes it almost does. I'm a big fan of both De Niro and Hathaway so maybe I was expecting too much. I mean, I was expecting Something. But what I got was only a little better than nothing. Enjoyable almost nothing, you understand, Robert and Anne have never been less than enjoyable, but the drama here is almost inconsequential. At least, I hoped that when something did happen De Niro's character would have something to do with its solution. Not so, the problem (you'll have to look hard to find it) is solved by the two characters themselves with no input from the title character. What we have is a group of nice likeable people being nice and likeable and doing nice and likeable things, but all that happens (SPOILER ALERT, FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE PICTURE) is that Quintessential Type A Anne/Jules is overworked and laid-back Robert/Ben helps her deal with this, occasionally dispensing poils of wisdom to the kids from his 70-year vantage point. That's it. Oh, there's some marriage difficulties that almost become drama but not quite, they're solved without even a discussion. If you're looking for relief from edgy high tension drama like ""Mama Mia II"" or ""Ocean's 8"" this is the picture for you. But you don't get out much, do you?", 8/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

jeffd-22496,"Humorous Very entertaining, DeNiro good, Many laughs, Couldn't second guess plot, loved the cast, simple engineering is best in plots, touching, emotionally satisfying, good ending - what really was well planned was the use of the automobile driving scenes, they seemed to tie together the plot and relationships, it must have been hard to figure out if the audience is going to stay with the plot as it unfolds when we live in a time where they over engineer special effects and try to make unreal jumps in here-to-there moves in the scenes to tie it all together. I liked that they used simpler environments and concentrated on story-telling of the cast so that the relationships could be expanded to realistic levels. This means that they were able to give the feeling of real people, not surreal.

The whole films from start to end has a few personal issues of realism, IE how companies work and process, but thats me being picky with attention to detail. The relationship between the two main characters has such depth that you can forgive the lack of understanding in the other areas, and its beautiful to see it blossom from the start you see there is a spark between then and the film managed to keep you wanting to find out whats happening next, to some extent you can guess and maybe figure it out, but all in all this is one of the best films like this iv seen in years, 8/10

The acting was also top-notch. I liked seeing Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in this movie together. They played their respective parts very well. I will not give away any spoilers, but there were certainly parts of this movie that I did not see coming. There are parts that will make you happy and at other times sad. This film had my attention the entire time. When the credits started rolling, I thought ""I want to watch this again."" I would highly recommend it!

debpriya-71877,"The truth is... something about you makes me feel calm, or more centered, or something.' Now and then a movie comes along that instead of polarizing senior citizens against the younger Internet media obsessed generation elects to show how mutually beneficial the two ends of the age spectrum can be. And that is what Nancy Meyers (The Intern, It's Complicated, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, The Parent Trap, Father of the Bride, etc) has accomplished with aplomb in writing and directing this very fine little comedy with strong philosophical overtones. The fact that she is working with a cast of impeccable actors adds to the pleasure and meaning of this very fine little film. But in the long run it is the mutual respect for the two ends of the age divide that makes this a true 'comedy' rather that a mocking spoof.

70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker Robert De Niro) has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) - a true barnstormer of a creative personality obsessed with her success of her start up business. Jules is married to a stay at home dad (Anders Holm) and has a spunky child, but her work seems to take precedence - until the concept of a senior intern is forced upon her. Gradually the two come together in the most respectful and endearing way and form a heartfelt partnership that both need.

The supporting cast - Rene Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew Rannells, Adam DeVine, Zach Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, Celia Weston et al - is to the person terrific. Played with a fine pacing and more information about Internet marketing than any book can offer, this is not only entertaining but a learning experience. Hathaway and De Niro are magic together.", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Something that modern cinematography has lost years ago, I only wish there are more movies like this. Excellent acting, touchy story and funny. I recommend you watch this during rainy Sunday afternoon with your loved one. This movie makes you think about important things in your life. Also for younger audience it as good example what life looked like when we are weren't chasing careers and wealth. It shows that nice behavior, hard working and kindness to people around us can bring something more awarding that success and money.

Things are happening in perfect order. And I never got bored, not even single second. Didn't expect this much great title before watching.

bird1515,"A feel good movie I enjoyed watching. I'm beginning to write more and more reviews because of all the poor reviews I have read on IMDb that has been misleading viewers.

People this isn't a Oscar winning movie, its not Casablanca. It's not going to leave you in tears, while winning award after award.

But what it is, is a really good film. It makes you feel good. Great actors and a really good plot that develops characters in a way where you get to know them.

Sometimes you want to be able to watch a movie and just enjoy it. Not have to decode it, or debate it, but just be able to relax and watch it.

So that's what this movie, a nice enjoyable film where Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have great chemistry and leave you with a smile.

A retired De Niro joins a thriving online fashion business with Hathaway and the two make for a great film.

Ignore the haters, De Niro has not lost his magic, and Hathaway is always a breath of fresh air.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

I didn't expect much of the movie because I'm usually a fantasy type of guy, but boy was I wrong. As the title says, it's a simple movie, easygoing, funny and smart.

I'm a big De Niro fan and after this movie I'm even more so. Anne and Robert really have have a great acting chemistry going on and I'd love to see a movie starring these two again one day. I don't want to spoil anything so I'm just gonna say that I felt really good after watching this because the movie just makes you feel so. It's good art, so if you're looking for a relaxing piece for yourself or your family you can't go wrong with this one!

nona9,"You won't regret watching this! When I see ""heartwarming"" in the film description I carefully avoid the title as it usually stays for ""your bowels will float out of your body with boredom"" ""attention: silence interlaced with nonsensical babbling in artistic sceneries"" , ""women pretending to be best friends at some countryside"", ""characters so insipid you will feel sick"" and ""cheesy happy ending alert / no idea for ending at all"" . This film however, is SO MUCH DIFFERENT than a typical mawkish comedy-drama: ingeniously played, authentic, unobvious and naive just in the right dose. I savoured every single minute of it and it was definitely the most positive thing I have watched for ages! The Intern is an instant day- maker and a true heart-warmer that urges you to be happy with life, act nice to people and become a better person for at least a couple of hours. Great job!!

ang_gpt619,"A Brilliant Heart-warming Movie!!!! Well after seeing the high rating score that the movie had managed to grasp, I sat down to watch the movie with really high hopes of getting a good laugh from it. But what happened was even more amazing. Its a classic tale of how we benefit from the wisdom of our elders.The movie went from one scene to another seamlessly and was able to retain my attention with utmost ease. Many feminists might disagree with me but being a high roller is a tough job, be a man or a woman. And especially in the current trend of start-up companies. But the way it was done, especially by the ball-buster (yet still vulnerable) character that Anne Hathaway played lent not only an air of authenticity but raised the movie standards to a whole another bar. And last but never the least, was the character played by Robert De Niro which makes me wish I would be half as mature and still so full of life when I reach the age of his character. Overall a brilliant production that does deserve a one time watch, if not twice or thrice.

krtkadsule,"Promising plot and promising beginning The movie starts off as with refreshing concept and gets you hitched early on. The concept of a senior citizen intern was completely new to me and I was curious to how Ben's (Robert De Niro) life will change with the internship how he will contribute and everything was quite interesting to imagine. As the movie progressed Robert De Niro was superb and half of the movie is engaging because of him. I believe the story could have been written and painted in a million ways.I just feel the plot had more potential than what is executed. The way the startup culture is depicted and the filming of a startup's work culture is quite brilliant. I loved the ending. It is almost perfect (no spoilers here). While watching at times I felt maybe the movie is digressing a little but still it was engaging and entertaining. Hats off to Nancy Meyer's for coming up with such interesting plot and story.

Chromium101,"Must Watch! The Intern is such a heartwarming movie, and hilarious at the same time. It is also one of the most realistic 21st century movies to-date.

Robert De Niro did a great job, although that's no surprise. But Anne Hathaway did a marvelous job acting out her character, I mean she made me fall in love with her character!

It goes without saying that I'm neither a fan of the two lead actors, as well as I'm usually a big movie skeptical when it comes to acting the characters as required, so she beyond impressed me.

I'd also like to note that this is my first IMDb review of a movie ever, that is because I rarely ever take the time to write any review about any movie. But this movie is just that special that makes you want to thank the directing team, cast team and anyone involved in making this movie possible.

Also if you haven't watched this movie yet, stop reading reviews because I guarantee you'll enjoy it.", 10/10,"0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

lisab-31726,"Finally! A GREAT Movie!!! I promise - no spoilers... Just two hours of funny! This was the BEST movie I've seen in 2 years! It was well written, great acting, and some real laugh out loud moments!!! It's a movie you'll see more than once!!!! Mr. deNero played the gentleman- the ""senior"" intern after retiring and figuring out... It's not all it's cracked up to be. Anne Hathaway is the young entrepreneur with a booming Internet business growing at a rapid pace- almost too fast. Surrounded by a great cast - some known... And not so know... They company decides to hire ""senior interns"" at which DeNero is a perfect fit.... To intern for the boss, that is. Scenarios and laughs ensue, so grab your friends, sit back, munch your popcorn and enjoy!

domnunycu,"A brilliant film. So. I waited a long time for this movie to apear on screen and it totally worth it. I knew it will be an interesting movie from the trailer and from the fact that is featuring two fun to watch and interesting actors that i always enjoy watching: Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway. This two are among my top 10 favourite actors. As for the actual movie, i would totally recommend it. The main story is great with some cool role-plays from "" the old man "". I don't want to make any spoilers, because i hate when people do this to me, so i just invite you to watch it for yourself. It has around 1 hour and a half, but you never get bored. I did watch it with very much interest and it had quite a handful of funny moments. One thing i noticed though, or maybe failed to notice. In the trailer there is a moment where the 4 co-workers talk at a drink and Jules start saying some comparison about the boys from "" now and then "" thing which in the actual movie i did not see. Overall a brilliant film.

srd091,"Amazing movie The movie is truly awesome and didn't I forget to say that you are never wrong to do the right thing, may be I was third one to say this after mark twain and Robert De Niro (Ben Whittaker). Old is gold, the movie proves this statement. And for women, I heard who sleep less than seven hours a night gain 38% more weight than women who sleeps more than seven hours a night. Anne Hathway is way too good with her acting and her charm obviously. I seriously started carrying handkerchief. There were some real great laugh out loud moments. I personally recommend this movie to everyone, guys watch it. Its a good movie after all. And at last, the experience never gets old.

dranuragjain,"The intern rules the roost An honest submission before i continue. Robert De Niro has matured and excelled like anything and like an aging wine, only to taste better. The plot is topical ,part funny,part serious and plausible.An aging retired single widower Ben Whitaker played superbly by De Niro yearns for some change and excitement joins a e commerce site as an intern headed by a workaholic adrenaline plenty Anne Hathaway. She to begin with is not comfortable with the idea of having an aging intern on her side. However like the proverbial turtle slowly and steadily he manages to win her and everyone's confidence in the office. Intertwined in the drama is her not so happy marriage which she desperately wants to save. Obviously in the end not only the intern gets what he wants but also in the process instills life and soul in her boss and the end is a happy mushy affair. What really works is the depth of this simple plot.The countenance and mannerisms of De Niro are smooth and superbly played by him.He looks neat and crisp in his formal suits. Anne Hathaway plays her part well though her histrionics towards the end the end to get a bit overboard. All in all a good watch.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

jimbobgt,"Breaking the glass ceiling After being recommended this film by a friend, my initial thoughts were that its going to be like 'The Internship' (2013) staring Vince Vaughn. Having not watched the trailer or heard much about The Interns release, I was committing myself to watching it with only the knowledge that its about an intern who looks old enough to be my granddad.

But WOW, what a fantastic film. You instantly begin to form a bond with Ben (Robert De Niro) which seems to only get stronger as the film progresses. A character who's portrayed as a laid back chilled out sort of guy is an instant hit with the whole team, from fellow interns, experienced colleagues and even the CEO. Because of this, it makes the movie a very feel good one, one which is able to cheer you up irrespective of your mood.

Another element of the plot that I particularly enjoyed was the fact that it shows the audience that a woman is able to run a successful business, especially in the 21st century. With the old stigma surrounding businesses that experience white men must be in charge, it was nice to see the film overcoming this taboo. Not only that but in my opinion it also shows the older generation that their skills and experience can be put to good use even after retirement, e.g. just because they are not 'tech-savvy' doesn't mean they can't learn.

Their are also elements of the film that touch on issues more personal to home such as affairs, divorce, parenting etc. Although these don't make up the full story, its good to see the movie actively tries to portray them as realistic as possible allowing the audience to relate to similar situations that might have affected their lives.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It followed a well written story line along with doing a fantastic job of informing views about what life can be like depending on your gender, age, career, to name but a few. Finally, by having two leading actors, from two different backgrounds, being able to support each other in the way they did, really beings home the message that if you put your mind to something and work hard at it then you can achieve it.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spring_A,"Light, touching and sweet I became interested in this film primarily because of the light atmosphere represented in trailer. And the duo of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro seemed promising. Well, the director Nancy Meyers did a great work. ""The Intern"" is a beautiful film with touching story. A story from everyday life, taken to screens, with some special elements, making you smile because of sweet situations shown in film. A story, that kind of tells you not to give up. Light humor only fills this perfect picture. I like good dramas. During watching ""The Intern"", it for some reason reminded me of ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Maybe it's because the film is based on the environment of the fashion industry, or maybe it's because of Anne Hathaway, or maybe even both. But after watching it I can honestly say, that Nancy Meyers's film has something in common with David Frankel's story, only ""The Intern"" is lighter and isn't so severe. ""The Intern"" is a perfect drama, а film that justified absolutely all expectations. A beautifully made story, which I didn't hesitate to give 10/10.

josephamichael,"A thoughtful review of the movie The Intern So, I just got done watching The Intern featuring the ever charming Robert De Niro and exemplary Anne Hathaway. (Not to mention the ever suave Rene Russo). I have some kudos to give and a word of authorship to the script writers for the movie.

1. The movie was incredibly heart felt. It touched me in all the right places. It was sincere and earnest and never felt like it was over done or campy. The actors fell into their roles in cadence and it transported me from the beginning to the end, with ease.

2. Robert De Niro aced his performance. The movie seemed to be written with an intimate knowledge of Mr. De Niro's previous performances and ability to transcend traditional roles. I dare to say this movie may have missed its mark all together with an alternate selection for the lead.

3. Anne Hathaway and Rene Russo were charming. I'm sure it wasn't easy for Ms. Russo to take a backseat to another leading lady. But she did so with charm and finesse and her character took on the challenge of a supporting role and did so with grace.

4. The movie was heartfelt and plucked the right strings. We felt the change of loyalty and even the butterflies of forgiveness. But...and this is a very strong but... (SPOILER ALERT) The writer missed a huge huge moment to take this movie to a whole other emotional plane of existence. Ms. Hathaway is at her wit's end trying to save a troubled relationship with her husband. So, she is trying to fill a vital role of CEO at her burgeoning company. Finally, she flies, with the company of Mr. De Niro, out to San Fransisco to meet one final and promising candidate for the position. After her interview with the potential CEO, she joins Mr. De Niro in the car that is bound for their return flight to NY. He asks her how it went. She goes on to profess how he was Smart and Kind and totally took her by surprise. The moment was so endearing, I felt the butterflies rise from my stomach and the tears begin to peak at the corners of my eye. Hope against hope I was waiting for her to extend her hand to Mr. De Niro and say, ""Congratulations CEO!"" That would have wrung my heart and made me fall head over heels in love with this movie, in a way unknown to me since Free Willy. Did it happen that way? Nope. The movie dragged to make a quick recovery of Ms. Hathaway's failing relationship and ended on a furiously paced band aid for her broken heart. Come on Hollywood Screen Writers! You get paid the big bucks, your duty is to elevate your audience. This was a fantastic movie but you missed the big finale! All critique aside, thanks for a touching tale with a few laughs and surprises along the way. And a challenge to Big Hollywood, think outside the box, for once! - @josephamichael", 10/10,"1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

bikingskiing,"Experience and youth have much to share A wonderful movie that will make you smile, laugh, and maybe even cry. The entire family can watch this one and enjoy the value that older people can bring to the workplace, even to an Internet start-up. I loved this movie. All performances were just about perfect, and Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro are both charming. Several themes interplay off each other; older people in a new tech workplace, working mothers trying to balance family, marriage and a career, and stay-at-home fathers; as well as perceptions of older people. Robert's character and several others in the movie put those stereotypes to the test. Finally, a well-made movie with a relevant story for our age that contains no violence or crude behavior. It's a fun and enjoyable movie to watch that it long overdue in the making.

arapaima-34606,"Great Movie I'll be honest, First time I have watched this movie because of these two great actors and then I have realized they all are great. Everyone. And then next day I have watched again. I always said that a great movie makes you thinking. This is a great one. The kind of movie you will remember forever and you will keep returning to it, to watch it again and again. This reminded me that every generation does have something good we need to remember. I just feel sad now, because I have to watch again so many bad movies until another great one is made. I won't say more because now I realize everything is so complicated about this movie, it's an entire universe in it, I would need to write a book and that's not possible. Brilliant! Does anyone know the feeling of getting quality instead of shallow? This is quality! It's rewarding.

annaovanesyan,"If you're looking for an easy watching and sincere movie 'The Intern' is a comedy/drama movie, which was directed by Nancy Meyers in 2015. The movie takes place in Brooklyn, New-York. The first thing, which attracted me, was the cast - Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro as the main characters. This duo seemed to me quite curious, so I wanted to find out what the plot is. Another reason why I decided to watch it was the place. A lot of movies and series are made in New-York, and I like when a movie contains breathtaking views of this city. As for me, it makes movies truly esthetic.

'The Intern' is a story about Ben Wittaker (Robert De Niro), who is 70 years-old. He has a family (son and grandchildren), which live quite far from him, and he's a widower. He has plenty of time and desire to do something new. Ben finds a vacancy in online-store of women's clothes. There he becomes an intern, and his duty is to help Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who runs this business. I think, the most fascinating thing about the plot is relationship between Jules and Ben. She's young and not experienced, he's wise and he has rich background in business. No matter, they have a huge age gap, they become good friends. Ben supports Jules, not only when it's about work, but in her private life. Jules's family is about to fall apart, and she thinks, if she hires a new director, her family will be fine again. It's a choice between her work, which is extremely important for her, and her family. What should she do? Can this decision save her relationship with her husband? It's a tough decision, but with Ben's help she makes a right one.

'Experience never gets old'. This is the general idea of the movie. I guess, it means that experience's always needed, it's always modern and it's always useful, no matter, what sort of experience it is. I love this idea and this movie in a whole. It's so kind and also dramatic. Acting makes you laugh, cry and then laugh again. Especially the very last scene makes you feel so calm and peaceful, and that'll be your emotions after watching the whole movie. I've seen 'The Intern' about 6 times, and every time characters make me relive these feelings.

I think, if you want to watch something easy, warm and heartfelt, you should certainly watch this movie. 'One of my favorite movies this last year was Nancy Meyers' The Intern. They're not considering that for the Oscars even though I think Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances this year in that movie. I thought the script was actually one of her best', said Quentin Tarantino and added that it's Oscar-worthy.", 10/10,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

The Intern really deserves a 10/10 rating, Robert De Niro, and Anne Hathaway play fantastic characters, with De Niro's performance as a elderly retired gentleman being heart warming and Hathaway's performance being quite balancing and nice. The movie provided quality character development and provided a nice reprieve to the outside world. Absolutely a definite watch!

This movie shows the imperfections of human in every corner where Ben kinda perplexed between two women at the beginning and Jules got confused with her purpose of life (running a business) when she found her husband's affair.

The atmosphere of this movie wasn't that exiting nor breathtaking but the dramatic sides of it covered everything, enough to end with a rightful happy ending. Good movie.", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

aivanenko,"An interesting and cute movie for relaxation and positive emotions ""The Intern"" is an interesting and cute comedy movie. It identifies at least two problems of social inequality in the modern world - inequality of young and old people in employment and gender inequality. The movie tells the story of a pensioner who, after the death of his wife, does not want to live to retire, but wants to work. Using the example of the protagonist, it is shown that there are provided equal opportunities for people of any age - he gets a job as an intern in a developing online clothing store. After a short time, having adapted his many years of experience in a newspaper factory to modern requirements, he becomes an assistant to the owner of the company, a young woman. The company is developing rapidly and has many orders and it's ruled by young woman. The movie emphasizes that she has a family, that she is not an arrogant person, and that she doesn't live on the dole. All this suggests that any woman can work hard and support a family, that everyone has equal opportunities, regardless of gender. Separately, it should be noted that in the movie, the heroine's husband is sitting with the child, which also emphasizes equality in determining roles in the family. Finally, it should be taken into account the movie, in pursuit of a happy ideal world of equality, skips an important, in my opinion, detail - it practically does not show how ""the intern"" misses his wife. On the one hand, it means that anyone can always start life from scratch, regardless of age. On the other hand, it is a sad element of the movie that was sacrificed to create a positive picture.", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

artegerevwork,"Break the prejudices In a nutshell, often our prejudices lead us to wrong conclusions about people. This film is excellent evidence of my words.

We're introduced with a retired man, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), who's not actually lose interest in life, even after becoming a widower. In his 70s, he's still smiling every day, open for new activities, making connections with people, staying polite and conservative.

One day, Ben seizes the senior fellowship opportunity in trendy fashion agency. He's sure that this's exactly what he needs: creative atmosphere, challenging tasks, ability to help others. But he's facing with prejudice from the side of colleagues. Nobody expects from old guy any awareness about clothes industry, nobody wants to spend their time with boring retirees. This is tough obstacle, but not for Ben. He understands such the common beliefs and just tries to help the firm doing his best. Ben, ex VP of phone book printing agency, has a great experience in business, and all his efforts happens to be extremely valuable in the fashion office, where everybody is in a hurry. Ben easily makes a rounds with his new co-workers and show his sensitivity and desire to cooperate with anybody who needs the help. So, main character refuted all the claims against old people's inability.

Personally, film is impressed me. I've already forgotten when I last time have seen such a kind and genuine movie. ""The Intern"" teaches us a lot: about good affairs with people, positive attitude to yourself, fairness, honesty, openness and full house of other things that we should never forget in our lives.

Probably, one of the most important takeaways from this film that person's true essence is inside and for that reason we could be dead wrong with our prejudice.", 6/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

monikawach-60971,"Funny and touching movie How great it is to watch a movie about a second life in retirement! Certainly the movie not one person has improved the mood and proved that life doesn't end with reaching retirement age! A story unlikely, but it's nice to watch a movie about motivation, action, making changes in your life for the better. Added to this is the thread of the tightening relationship between the main characters (between the intern and the boss). You can see how Jules's approach to people changes under the influence of contact with Ben. I highly recommend this movie for long fall and winter evenings!

mistersvyat,"Great and inspiring film Film ""The Intern"" is a great example of strong and impressive humans' lives regardless of age and gender. To start with, this story is about the old widower Ben, who has tried everything in his life, but being an intern is a novel experience for him. It is surprising, but he immediately becomes a personal intern of the boss (Jules), that is a young and very powerful woman, even somebody tell him: ""Hang in there."", but in response, Ben only smiles. Their relations with the boss are not good, he was deprived of Jules' attention, may be because she mistakenly think, that elder cannot help her. Nevertheless, their story begins, when Ben perfectly deals with a problem of Jules' drunk driver. Here viewer shakes hands with scenarist on the fact that only internal qualities of people matter, not age, not gender, not religion... It is very surprising, but ambitious woman and experienced elder become best friends. Ben was the man, who rescued Jules' life from two very dangerous decisions, so sometimes very unexpected things (such as an internship for elder) gives the opportunities, one has never dreamed of. Jules is sometimes unhappy, her staff is offering a new CEO for her company (to replace her), moreover her husband has an affair. Ben helped her to recover from adversity, to save her position and family. It is very nice of him to offer a possibility of being buried together, as there is a lot of place near his wife's grave. But fortunately it is not necessary in the end of film.", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

amynugent-70312,"De Niro wonderful, but film is meh Robert de Niro as Ben the intern is wonderful. It's heartwarming and nice to see an elderly person get a new lease on life as an intern. Also, his relationship with Jules is sweet and comforting.

But the plot of the film is lacking. It feels like the only purpose of the film was to observe a sweet old man. Which is nice. But lacking still. Also some of the lines are not it.

Lots of strange mini plots...Jules rides a bike around the office 'dude'. Jules is told to get a ceo. Jules doesn't like her mother. Jules conducts a heist of her mothers house, followed by celebratory shots at the bar where Jules talks of how men are lost in society. Then Jules' husband has an affair, whilst her daughter has friendship problems. And the younger intern who lives with Ben.

It's just a bit random and mismatched. The main consistency is the sweetness of Ben, and his relationships and influence on people. It's a nice film. But lacks something. Could've been done better. I think the moral of the story, that life can be lived at any age, is good. But the plot around that was weak.", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

Had a couple of hours to kill and saw this on Netflix. So thoroughly entertaining that its flaws meant nothing.

Is it a classic that will be remembered and studied for years? Absolutely not.

Is it a movie that entertained me to the point that I'm so glad I watched? Absolutely yes.

So, it's not original, it raises a few questions that we might disagree with or whatever, but this movie made me laugh, then cry, and at the end it left me with a sense of warmth. I really enjoyed it. I used to watch movies based on critics' evaluations, but now I know better.

fsstudy,"Troubled route with too happy ending The plot has been summarised extensively, so won't do that here. First, the older non internet-savvy intern: really, would a 'senior' be so ignorant (it was their generation that invented the internet) and how to join Facebook? The busy neurotic business creator: I had an Editor much like Anne Hathaway's character and so could relate to her as a genuine role, but with the size of her business I'm surprised that she didn't have meetings/conferences with junior management, which surely would have been set up by the time the film plot starts. The new girlfriend for the Intern: the featured Imdb reviewer sees the company masseuse Fiona as needing Ben, the intern. But it is Ben who is initially turned on by her, which she follows through perhaps realising older people do get more muscular twinges and provides relaxation treatment for him (he does also have an age related heart condition). The house husband seems slightly disparaging about his job caring for Hathaway's daughter having given up his part in the business, and is not surprisingly too tired for intimacy with his wife, a scene nicely played. I was surprised she didn't engage in sharing the business issues with him as a consequence and so keep him in tow. All that being said, it's a pleasant movie and apart from skirting over how the investors in the startup (they seem very remote) want a new ceo to run the operation, I felt the story threads came together nicely at the end.", 10/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Please ignore the rest. Just well doing the required.

They just don't dare to say it openly, they wanted to weed out the down revs and reviewers and came up with a new model that does more harm than any good to the site. They want to reviews to be much more positive since scores are shred on video platform and negative reviews makes them look very bad and makes shareholders unhappy if they see a low score of a movie or series.

P. S. I still cant fathom that I would have had to write out this whole paragraph . Bruh!!

wiktorzajac,"Fulfillment originate from ours inner drivers - not the expertise level When I first saw this title and the description, I was a little bit skeptic. I've had it on my watchlist though I was putting it off for a few weeks. Finally my curiosity about Robert De Niro performance as a retired 70-year-old widower named Ben won with me and I started watching. After first few minutes of the movie, I knew it is about to be a seed for a whole lot of deep thoughts.

I believe that we - people - often strive to fill a hole in our lives without even properly identifying its cause. Second minute of the movie hit with a phrase spoken by Ben - ""I realized the key to this whole deal was to keep moving. Get up, get out of the house, and go somewhere. Anywhere."". Before I've heard it from De Niro, I couldn't convince myself to believe in this thought, especially the last part, which states that going anywhere is sufficient. I didn't agree with it instantly, but for me, the whole movie was a beautiful journey to understanding these words. Anna Hathaway played a crucial role in it, because I am not gonna lie - she seduced me as Jules Ostin, workaholic who happens to be a founder of a company, Ben's boss, but first of all - emotional human being trying her best to achieve happiness.

The story of Jules shows that happiness doesn't come from aligning with others, making sacrifices and hiding things from too observant people. On the contrary - its root are in the openness. It is also not required to be an irreplaceable expert to feel fulfillment. It is entirely sufficient to be an intern. It is all about to what environment we bring unique value of ourselves and how we, and our surroundings, perceive it.", 7/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

cshoemaker-49248,"A Charm that falls short The Intern had been on my list for a while. Advertised as a feel-good movie, it appeared to fit the role of the movie charm you play in the background of your living room once every few weeks such as Serendipity or You've Got Mail.

It almost hit that mark. I say almost because the concept and motive was there but the script and the character development just fell short. The Intern tried to fit the category of an authentic, uplifting, movie but never trusted its audience to carry it to that destination.

Every interaction or relationship just felt superficial or forced. Scenes between characters provided so much dialogue and direction that nothing ever evolved organically. The script almost felt like it was scared of empty spaces between scenes, scared of body language or silence communicating the message in its own way. Instead, these moments were filled with bland dialogue that never let the scene reach its true feel-good potential.

There is a similar scenario with the relationships between characters in this film. Some were started but never revisited, others were started and completed offscreen without the audience taking the journey with the characters. They just became more missed opportunities.

The blueprints for The Intern were there but were not executed to its truly great potential.

Having said that, there are still great takeaway moments, and it is not a total failure, just something that could have been much more.", 5/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

jimal005,"I loved this movie. It will make you relax... I loved it guys the acting, emotions and the story are amazing and make you feel peace. The acting of Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are sensational and fulfilling. I would recommend this movie to all stressed out people and I am sure they will find some peace and smile after watching it.

What makes this movie so special? I will say the flow of the movie makes special. The total cast deserves appreciation for it. Secondly, there is no noisy or irritating action, sex, violence or CG which you will see in most of the movies released in the past decade. You won't get bored even for a second. Seriously I got really irritated when something or someone disturb me while watching it. Because I was totally in to that movie and It happens very rare.

So what you are waiting for? go for it and watch it.

This is how modern films should be written . It is fun , amusing and most importantly it teaches you the ""value"" of a handkerchief. All the actors were exquisite and i would recommend this film to every person i know. You should watch this regardless of your genre preferences. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and it is the first time in a very long time when i get out of the room with a smile on my face.

From the first start of the movie a big smile on my face. This movie has it all. Great actors, comedy and drama.

The feeling De Niro's character brings happiness to others not just by what hes doing but also by just being the way he is.

This is by far one of my favorite movies of 2015.

A great movie.

Didn't like the casting for Hathaway's husband. He didn't seem to be a good match for her character role. Everything was great up until the end. It was too cheesy and the husband's acting was just too fluffy. It made me rate it at a 5 and want to write my first movie review as a disappointment. And the ending was poorly written and executed. I recommend watching if in the mood for a light comedy but expect to be disappointed at the end. I'll be mad about this till I watch a new movie. Grr

mateofebres,"What a friendly movie This was such a friendly, light - hearted movie! Really enjoyed it from start to finish, and the plot was gripping enough. It goes beyond saying, Hathaway and De Niro both excell as an acting couple, she is one of the great performers of our time and he, well you know who he is. At first you might think of it in a Nabokov - style but it just does not play that way at all. It is more a tale of classicism vs. contemporary and it works! Maybe a little unoriginal but the movie is a breath of fresh air to De Niro's filmography. Lately, his movies kind of lack of himself, and he lost the stigma he had about cinema back when he shot Meet the Fockers. You can tell how excited he is for being there and that is just beautiful. Anyone can enjoy this movie, and appreciate the above average camera work, and even some symmetry clammed in as well. Again, De Niro delivers a role that goes different from what he has been accustomed to play lately, taking into account that his latest movies involve him in an ""oldie but goodie"" personna (talke Last Vegas and Dirty Grandpa for instance) but he is not the same in each role despite the character his age has him play. He radicalizes these roles, and contrasts them so well, despite the quality of thee. Really enjoyable movie to relax in the summer, pretty laid back, and it is beautiful to still be able to witness a performance by one of the greatest artist of our generation! Specially paired up with Anne, just works somehow. Looking forward to watching this acting relation progress, Scorsese, might want to pay attention. Fresh movie, funny and touching at crucial points.

fitzer1,"Purely A Magical Movie Experience never gets old, is an apt brief description of this eventual classic. Make sure you ""...carry a handkerchief,"" so that is what they eventually are for. A near perfect soundtrack in the background subtly helps bring it all together as well. It took me weeks to decide to watch it, now I cannot believe that I was afraid to pop the cork!!

Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have such a great chemistry together as eventual ""Padawan"" and ""Life's Mentor"". They don't just go through the motions, they both bring great acting chops to their roles, with even a laugh or three. It began to grow on me about 80 minutes in. It starts out slightly slow but ages into a fine wine by the conclusion. Don't hesitate to let it age on you!

archimoz,"The special bonding between a young lady & a (grand) father - figure. While watching Nancy Meyer's 'The Holiday', it occured to me that the story of the special bonding between Kate Winslet & Eli Wallach is the most endearing sub-plot of the movie.

In 'The Intern', this special bonding has been amplified & augmented nicely. Anne Hathaway is vibrant & successful but could do with a bit of (grand) fatherly attention & care (something that she may have missed in her childhood, having a mother with a strong personality).

The trust & affection between the two characters, build up naturally & nicely.

An enjoyable movie, with some pleasant & non contrived lessons about life.

dheerudhingra,"Worth Watching - Entertaining The Intern is an entertaining one. The plot is unique and interesting.

The protagonists, Jules and Ben, are very strong characters and are played beautifully by Anna and Robert De Niro, respectively. Ben despite being from the old generation supports the idea of working woman and is a sorted person who offers helping hand to everybody.

I learned two things from the movie - Keep your energy focused on what matters by keeping the other things simple and ""You're never wrong to do the right thing - Mark Twain"".

It is worth investing time.

Did I say ""sex""? Oh, well. This movie is also a bit of sci-fi. Actually more ""fi"" than ""sci"", because, let's be clear on a detail... to have a Anne Hathaway wife jumping at you in bed - and you to turn your back to her ?????

pborders-27520,"The Life of an Executive Women Although Ben Whittaker (De Niro), the intern, is the central character of this movie, as a female manager and titled officer of a multi-billion international corporation, I easily identified with the Jules Ostin (Hathaway) the company founder. Like her, I face the same challenges in a high pressure job. How she tries so hard to make everyone happy to the point of sacrificing her own happiness. Of particular note, is how her own gender slanders Jules with disparaging remarks while conversing with Ben. These selfish women relish in humiliating and belittling Jules in ways that make her question her womanhood. To say this movie is ""cute"" is like saying ""oh that's nice"" to a soldier who just returned from front-line battle in Afghanistan. The point is, even when a woman is the founder of a company, the ""glass ceiling"" is still there unless she gets the support she deserves and needs in her professional and personal life. I loved this movie and would highly recommend it to men and women of all ages.

piyushcool-24496,"A 70 years old man got an internship in an online company. But who will gain experience? The intern or the company? The Intern is a story of retired old man 'Ben'(Robert De Niro) who got internship in a online clothing company ran by 'Jules'(Anne Hathway) and how her life changes when Ben become part of her life.

The plot is polite and lovable. It mainly revolve around Ben and Jules. Great work has been done by Robert De Niro and Anne Hathway. Love the background score by Theodore Shapiro. Small comedy scenes really helped in holding the plot for a while. While some didn't. But the story is so simply lined that you will feel very relaxed watching it and also you will enjoy the work of De Niro.

So, If you are looking for a calm and lovable movie and of course if you are a fan of De Niro and Anne Hathway, you should definitely watch this movie.

migsfigs,"Another Would-Be Hollywood Drama/Comedy With a well-known and Academy Award winning cast, a relatively unique concept, and potential for several social statements (particularly gender and age), the film could have been a heart- warming, thought-provoking drama, but was suppressed mainly due to a seemingly rushed and plot-less screenplay.

The ""story"" (or rather a glimpse of some character's lives) followed Ben (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower, hired as an intern for a fashion site run by a frantic and busy woman, Jules (Anne Hathaway), dealing with business problems as well as relationship problems. Throughout the film, Jules is confronted with problems that challenge her role as a mother and a leader of a company, all of which Ben observes and assists in whichever way he can. In reality, the plot has no real structure; it has a beginning: Ben is hired, but the middle appeared to consist of minimal conflicts, and the end was as satisfying as, well, most movies nowadays. One of the more painful results of the story was the emerging of rather important issues of our time (the role of woman in our society, as well as that of the elderly) but completely obliterating the possible emotional impact by having the characters admit their stances (have we never heard of ""show don't tell""?).

The acting itself was not unexpected: several scenes of Hathaway sobbing and De Niro's humble old-man expressions, all of which were good, however concealed with the atrocious storytelling of the writer/director who preferred prettiness over content.", 8/10,"0 out of 3 found this helpful.

laelcwhite,"violation of massage therapy ethics I enjoyed the movie except for the part where the company-contracted ""masseuse"" (just hold up right there, that term is so antiquated!) gratuitously comes on to the main character while giving him a 'chair massage', fondling around his love handles inappropriately, whereupon he is depicted as becoming aroused. This is a violation of any Massage Ethics course #080 in the country. Of course, the scene is depicted as quirky fun. Oh, yes, then they begin to 'date', another blatant violation of massage ethics. I could have given it 8 stars maybe, for it's commentary on urban, comfort-class social quandaries around gender and age. But sorry no. Become aware, people, please, do we need to be continuing to snicker at the massage profession? Can we grow up now?

sassyfras-82502,"Time well spent When I saw the reviews for this movie in the theater, I got the impression that it was going to be a caricature of elderly in the workplace, i.e.forgetful,and disorganized. But this movie was a pleasant surprise. Robert DeNiro's character was thoughtful and competent. He gave it just the right touch. I also liked Anne Hathaway's character. She was an owner of a online Amazon-like company. She seemed too rushed and frazzled. (Don't know if that is what she was trying to portray or not) and she seemed a little young for her position. Do CEO's ride their bicycles in the warehouse ? That seemed a little silly. And her employees seemed fresh out of college (or high school) and acted it. Not much of a plot but.was fairly easy to follow, but there were characters that seemed to be thrown in as fillers. The chauffeur was on screen not over a minute. Thankfully no nude scenes or profanity. It was the best ""feel good"" movie I have seen in a while.

michaelkamarad,"No bad - but mini-vomit included The Intern was not such a bad movie - alone the depicted ridiculous leftist ""modern softie"" role-model of men is deplorable, humiliating and unbearable. I had to hit my wife around the house a bit after watching so I got reassurance I am still a man :P That was a joke of course but the nucleus of my criticism is appropriate and concise from an objective point of view. De Niro and Hathaway play their roles as good as they can be played considering the setting and characters. Hathaway's husband is not only ugly and leagues under her - he is also the witchking of the above mentioned manly role-narrative. The detailed business-conduct differences between the old-school business-type of Robert de Niro and the modern Internet-age online-shop business-type embodied by Anne Hathaway was quite lucid and nice but does also not heave the movie into a higher movie-experience.

The movie was a full package of themes surrounding friendship, loyalty, chivalry, marriage, family, sacrifice, life, preserving novelty yet embracing change all together, going for your dreams, getting to know yourself, peace with oneself, and most of all courage, among anything else. This movie made me cry and dwell deeper and look at my 30-something life thru the eyes of a career-driven, millennial like Jules (Anne Hathaway); yet it also made me ponder on what lies ahead and what I would ever want to achieve thru Ben's life (Robert Deniro. A brilliant Gem of a movie! I specially suggest all millennials watch this! :-D

trzeyen,"Very, very good, EXCEPT.... The movie was excellent and very moving in many ways EXCEPT...

SPOILER: the movie implies that somehow human forgiveness alone and/or human hope through some sort of philosophic adherence to humanistic philosophy and possible adherence to Eastern Religious Mysticism's Tai Chi practice might be some sort of effective unifying solution for their problems that will somehow bring true healing and wholeness in the end. Reconciliation at the end of the movie without any of the characters ever coming to a genuine knowledge that the only true hope of forgiveness and healing is available through trusting in the Lord Jesus and His sacrifice on the cross for their personal sins alone as their ONLY hope. Otherwise this movie should generally only be recommended for those who already really know the biblical truth of what's really going on in this universe otherwise, unfortunately, only a false and deceptive humanistic solution is offered at the end of it all.

saratparayil,"A Well Made Movie the movie was so cheerful and romantically attached one.it had a good pace from starting to end.it was very long after i have seen Robert-DE Niro movie. i have to accept that it was one of best roles i liked.for Anna Hathway also this was best performances after devil in Parda. the relationship between both have been shot very carefully and also some humor in it.only breaking the house was little more to swallow.But in some point of view that seen is also OK. you will enjoy the movie throughly. you cannot see much movie well made like this because now a days movies are made from ugly comedy and romance. the director show how a romantic comedy movie should be made

zachgala,"Beautiful and joyous movie Beautiful movie that has covered so many aspects of our everyday life! Nancy Meyers is an amazing producer! Brilliant movie, that puts you in such an ease and makes you want to watch more and more of it. Lots of laughs and ending was a true blessing. We have rented it, but will buy it so that to support Nancy's beautiful job and for gifting us two hours of real joy! I have actually understood that you have to choose which movie to watch by choosing your favorite producer. I have found my first best producer. Nancy Meyers is a perfect fit in her life for being such talented producer! All of her movies are the ones that you'd watch more than once and would want to share with your friends and loved ones.

fredericmaurer,"Not bad but had so much potential I'm pretty ambiguous about this movie. I really liked the way Robert De Niro played the elderly Ben who is trying to find his way back into life with a senior internship with to successful e-commerce entrepreneur Jules, played by Anne Hathaway. The way they're relationship as friends grows in a wonderful way. Even though I really enjoyed most of the movie but I found quite a few parts really disappointing.

While I'm okay with this movie being extremely PC I think they really missed pointing out the downsides of the displayed lifestyle. They did portray a few problems but in the end everything seems to fall back into place without any suffering or any real compromises. Everything is just awesome for Jules and everyone supports her regardless of the mistakes she made before (and at no point really stopped making). The movie kind of ends just where it started which was really unsatisfying for my.

All in all I liked the characters but think that the storyline had much unused potential.", 9/10,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

maddihaltom,"Intern! I recently rented the Intern from on demand at home! I thought it was a great movie, with amazing actors, and a classic story about Internet start-ups. It shows the struggles that Jules Ostin (Ann Hathaway) has with running and being the CEO of her own company. With the help of Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) her 70-year-old intern, she is able to get her home life back together and make important business decisions on where to bring her company next. The movie is perfect examples of how different the generations are and how technology has changed basically everything. Robert De Niro and Ann Hathaway both do such a good job in this movie and bring a wonderful chemistry as well. I would defiantly recommend seeing this to anyone especially those wanting to do start a start up business.

gkisare,"offensive The references to bipolar disorder in this movie, equating this devastating and potentially fatal illness, to a 4 year old's temper tantrum is at the height of insensitivity and cruelty. The scene I am referring to is the one where the dad is talking to his 4 year old daughter about her moody little friend. He says ""sounds like she is bipolar"" with a little smirk on his face. Later in the movie he and his daughter are at the playground. They see this little friend, she scowls and hides behind her mother. He and his daughter look at each other and smile, ""Yep, bipolar"". I have bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic symptoms. I have attempted suicide once and been hospitalized three times. I will need to take medicine for the rest of my life. I daily face the possibility that I may develop a condition called tardive dyskenesia, a permanent condition that resembles Parkinson's disease, as a result of one of the mood stabilizers I must take to be able to function. That ignorance like this still exists in mainstream media amazes me. Miss Meyers needs to spend some time serving patients in psychiatric ward to treat her own lack of compassion and ignorance. I will never watch one of miss Meyers' movies again. It is a shame that those of us suffering with diseases of the brain cannot sit down with our families and watch a seemingly harmless movie without worrying about being emotionally assaulted. Do not see this movie and participate in stigmatizing and cruel attempts at entertainment. If I could permanently remove this movie from public consumption I would. It is poison.",,"0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

mysteryeyes-95624,"Sweet and Heart Warming I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my family. I found the characters cute and quirky and enjoyed it from the beginning through the end. The movie kept me interested in the characters and what was going on in each scene relating to the stories delivered. The movie does It job in delivering characters and story lines which keeps you interested and wanting more. Robert plays his role perfectly and I couldn't help liking and wanting the best for his and Anne's characters. To me, The Intern is one of those movies that you are disappointed when it ends because you want to spend more time enjoying the characters. Robert and Anne delivered their performances very well. The movie brought me laughter, dismay, intrigue, and tears. I recommend this movie to those who like quirky, cute movies, with dashes of seriousness.

hediregaya,"Deep breath of ""humanism"" During this movie and after... You feel how this is important it is to show empathy towards others, to understand their worries, their problems... To be altruist.. And how this positively affects you as an individual. Being modest, being a intern, being just yourself, doing your work and again, how this will positively be rewarded The contrast between the ""old school"" way of doing business and the start-ups state of mind is another important piece in this movie as it shows that both can coexist and create a beautiful melting pot. The performance of De Niro is just awesome, he is actually a great actor, the disconnection between the previous roles (gansters, mafioso, and others...) and the drama roles he plays the last couple of years is just impressive. Thanks for this lesson of humanism

ade_braw,"Real Movie to make your good day What I'm going to say is It's a really good movie! I really love it. Love the actors. Love every scenes of it. Love the story. The issue which tells us about feminism were packed in a good way. No one's hurt by this movie. The happy- ending also packed in some kind of ""balance"" by showing some TaiChi moves at the end of it. The movie also tells us about people with high level integrity and work-ethics in their workplace, something almost extinct nowadays.

Anne Hathaway always be the perfect-suit to play this kind of role, as she did in Devils Wears Prada. What I'm little bit surprising was the warm-uncle-look role played by Robert De Niro as I only noticed most of his role are as Mafia or someones who commit criminal.

patricijabajare,"Something different than usual Amazing, unpredictable and definitely unusual movie.

Recommend this to everybody. While watching this film I had very different emotions and feelings. In this movie you can cry a little bit, you can laugh a little bit. Also the film was very enjoyable because how I said earlier it was unusual. It wasn't the same plot that we all know and have seen before.

It is hard to say what is so special about this movie, but there definitely is something. For example after the story you realize how different and unusual events could happen in your life. We understand that it's never too late to make big decisions. Because those decisions can lead us to much better life than we have know. And your ages is not always the biggest problem.

What I want to say is that you just need to enjoy this thrilling and beautiful story!",,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

trizzle-90957,"different than I expected Maybe it is my fault for not reading enough about it beforehand, but I had the impression that this would be a goofy and lighthearted comedy about the differences in values, practices, language, etc. between baby boomers and millennials. (With actors like Adam Devine and Anders Holm in the cast, can you blame me? Also, I think they wanted to get Blake Anderson as well, but couldn't, so they just put a substitute in there. If you see it, you'll know who I mean.)

Instead, it's a somewhat sappy (not quite a romantic comedy though) story about the trials of the working professional mother and how wisdom through life experience can be used to improve her life. The story is not bad. There are some cringe worthy references to sexism in business thrown in there, and the working mother gets judged by the stay at home moms (who eventually get called out). However, she is not generally presented as a poor oppressed woman in tech, kept down by the evil Patriarchy. Instead, she is presented as someone overwhelmed by her own busy life, but committed to taking responsibility and just needing some guidance. It's a situation that I think people can relate to.

Overall, it's a decent date movie with some laughs. But Workaholics it is not!",,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

samanthadare-88887,"Feel good movie I loved this movie and the way that Robert De Niro was represented as the older man. The arc of transformation from Gangster to Grandad is done well.

The relationship between old and new is brought together to create a movie that makes you smile. Hathaway has a fabulous on screen persona which works well with De Niro.

At times the movie is comical accompanied by a sentimental narrative which keeps you engaged.

I would recommend this movie as it's a bit of light entertainment that reminds viewers of how gentleman used to be and still are in some cases!

Well worth a viewing.

robertantcliff,"A Feel Good and Uplifting Film The Intern is a film which is multifaceted and covers many different topics in a way that is enjoyable and easy to watch.

In this film Ben is used to portray the old man who is out of touch with the modern world. Jules is used to portray the modern woman who breaks the social norms of the stay-at-home mother to pursue her dreams. Matt is a depiction of the possible role of the modern day man as a stay-at-home Dad and Jules and Matt's relation is the depiction of a modern relationship.

The film takes you through these characters' lives and how the old can mixed in with the new and can still be relevant in a modern age.

If you're looking for a film that you can analyse and pick apart then this film isn't for you. But if you want a film that you can sit down and enjoy with your significant other and not think about too much, then this film should be on your watch list.",,"0 out of 0 found this helpful.

erikaanje,"I don't like movies... ...and the reason for that is because I usually find myself feeling disappointed, uninspired, and empty.

I watched the preview for The Intern and couldn't feel LESS motivated to watch a movie which had the potential to be so clichéd and predictable. Old man, young businesswoman, she hates him, then slowly starts to like him, cutesy/special friendship forms, he stays at her company forever and ever and so on...

But this movie wasn't like that. It was actually the kind of movie where I was glad I was watching it alone because it had so many simple lovely moments throughout the film that I couldn't stop tearing up. I pretty much cried through the whole film (but don't worry, that's just me!)

As far as casting goes, I was pretty impressed. I initially questioned why De Niro might be appearing in what looked like a ""chick flick"" (totally not a chick flick by the way!) but after I saw it, it made a lot of sense. And his performance was, of course, impeccable as ever. The rest of the cast was great too.

I also need to acknowledge the writers of the film for taking a risk in respect to the relationship between Hathaway's character and the husband, played by Anders Holm. When their circumstances take a difficult and emotional turn, the events that follow are surprising and engaging to say the least. It's definitely not your standard rom-com and that's what makes this movie so great.

So, now that it has been about ten minutes since the movie ended and my tears have dried, I can safely say that I loved this film SO much and am glad I took a chance on it. Yes it was heartwarming and made me feel all fuzzy inside BUT.... there was something realistic and powerful about this movie that you don't come across often.

Highly recommended.",,"0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

lps_awesome,"The Intern is an amusing movie to watch because it takes common scenarios and puts a twist on it,. College and high school students often get internships at companies over the summer to get real, in-the-field work experience. Other times, students get internships as something to put on their college applications, giving them an edge over others. However, in the movie ""The Intern"" by Nancy Meyer, the new intern at the company is an 70 year old retired man. The CEO of this company is a young woman, around age 23, who started the company herself. She believes that she has to do everything at the company and demands to oversee everything. The new intern has his internship at an online fashion store company. Ben Whittaker, the intern, has no idea how to work a computer. He does not have an email, he does not know how to navigate Facebook, much less does he know how to online shop. In Nancy Meyer's movie, ""The Intern,"" it takes common scenarios and twists them to go against stereotypes, making the movie amusing to watch.

Ben Whittaker is the 70 year old intern who knows nothing about computers. However, he is still successful in the company because of his proper ways. He teaches the rest of his coworkers the proper mannerisms needed to excel at life and please your boss. Despite not knowing anything about the company, he does small things around the office and helps out the CEO, Jules, to make her day a little simpler. One morning, Ben gets to work extra early to help Jules clean up an extra messy table so she has one less thing to stress about. Ben makes an effort to do all these small things, such as driving her to and from work, which add up to help warm his way into Jules's heart. She eventually accepts him and they become very close friends, to the point that she trusts him with her life. Ben Whittaker goes against most stereotypes because he is a retired man who knows nothing about computers, however, he is still able to make it in the company.

Besides Ben, Jules, the boss and starter of the company, also defies stereotypes. She has a child, and her husband is a stay at home husband who does all the cooking, cleaning, and other familial stuff. On the other hand, Jules is a strong, hard-headed woman who believes in overseeing everything and doing everything to make sure it is done. In one clip of the movie featuring the other stay-at-home mothers of the children who go to Jules's daughter's preschool, Ben is talking to the women and the dislike for Jules is obvious, either because they are jealous, or think she does not spend enough time with her child. Once again, Jules goes against most stereotypes that a boss should be a firm, Caucasian man with a stay-at-home wife who does the dishes.

The movie ""The Intern"" is very interesting in the fact that it takes common scenes and adds a tweak to make it go against most stereotypes. Watching these different scenes play out also adds a hint of humor into the movie, making it enjoyable to watch. Ben Whittaker is a retired worker who knows nothing about this type of work, defying the stereotype that interns are college students looking for a job. Continuing to defy clichés, the boss of this company is a young woman who has a daughter and stay-at-home husband, going against the stereotype that all CEO's are Caucasian men with trophy wives. Because of the twist in scenario, the movie is able to add humor into it, making it amusing to watch.",,"0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.

NataliaC,"nice, but not as good as it could have been This movie turned out to be more drama than comedy, which is what I was looking forward to. While I don't regret watching it, there was one aspect that made it hard to get through at times: the Matt character (played by Anders Holm). Every time there was a scene with him the movie was like a song that suddenly fell flat. I figured, ""The people who cast this movie know what they are doing, it must be me,"" so I really tried to appreciate him--to no avail. I think his part was both written as two-dimensional and acted flatly, especially in contrast to the effusive and expressive Anne Hathaway, the endearing Robert De Niro, and other surprising performances. All the other main characters/actors were delightful. The movie had some fun scenes, but over all was somewhat slow-moving for this decade. It could have been pared down. Linda Lavin's character, for example, was extraneous. Neither a bad movie nor a memorable one. If you don't have great expectations, you'll probably enjoy this film.

The movie plot was amazingly well scripted, the movie brings out the generation gap and teaches how one with an experienced life adult could help the young ones to inspire. The best part was about the handkerchief, where the old guy suggest to the young one to have a handkerchief so when the time is right you could lend a handkerchief to women/girl. All the way around ,it was a wonderful movie.

tonkacheer,"Robert De Niro Proves to be ""The Right Fit"" for The Intern My love for Nancy Meyers films was proved true once again with The Intern. With hits like The Holiday, Father of the Bride, and It's Complicated, I was not surprised with the hard work shown throughout The Intern, a comedy-drama film starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.

The storyline of The Intern doesn't feel too predictable and contains enough plot twists along the way to keep you guessing. From character shifts to relationship struggles, I couldn't take my eyes off this film. On top of the exciting storyline, the direction and setting also add to the film.

The Intern is about Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, a retired, widowed, seventy-year-old who worked as an executive for DEX One. Ben finds himself bored while living an uneventful, retired life in Brooklyn, New York and after seeing a flyer, he applies and lands a senior intern role for an online fashion website.

Working completely online is initially a challenge for Ben, someone who worked for a phonebook company for forty years. The difference in age of Ben and his Co-Interns gives him the opportunity to teach them with his knowledge and experience and they return the favor by teaching him all about Facebook and simple tasks like how to turn on his new work laptop. On top of the technology struggles, Ben is placed to work directly alongside the founder of the company Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway. From the beginning, Ben is warned this task is going to be a tough one but despite the difficulty of the task, he uses his intellectual wit and charm to impeccably fill the role.

Robert De Niro never fails to bring laughter to the film as he has done so before in Meet the Parents, Dirty Grandpa, and The Comedian. Aside from bringing laughter to the film, De Niro will continue to warm your heart scene after scene as he takes the extra step to help Jules out both in and out of the office.

Not only does De Niro perfect his role, but Anne Hathaway as Jules Ostin is nothing short of spot on. Jules Ostin was a stay at home mom before being inspired to create an online shopping website centered around the difficulty behind finding ""The Right Fit"" in clothing. Hathaway embodies this role with great passion as she promotes women in the workforce while also standing firm in her role at her company when they are contemplating bringing in an outside CEO.

Although the film portrays moms in the workforce, like Jules Ostin, as very hardworking, the film also gives off the vibe that working moms are not able to also be good moms. This may come off a bit harsh and unappealing to working moms who view this film and I believe that Meyers, a working mother herself, could have done a better job avoiding this.

Each scene of the film has been long thought out and carefully staged and filmed. In one particular scene, subjective point of view through the eyes and ears of Jules was used as she observes the objects in bathroom surrounding her. Following this shot there's a straight cut to Matt in the bedroom on the other side of the door. The remarkable angles and shots bring a variety of emotions to the viewer without the use of words throughout the entire scene.

The Intern exemplifies the idea over and over again that we all have something to learn from someone else. As Jules and Ben continuously learn and grow with each other throughout this film, so will your desire to keep on watching and unveil the outcome of Jules predicaments.",,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.

katejacqueline,"The Intern Will Get You Excited About Working... That's a First As I begin to think more about my future and career options, I am drawn to Design and Marketing. In the movie, The Intern, most of the movie takes place in an office setting. This is where the main character, Jules, runs her up and coming business. The setting is what initially got me excited to watch this movie. Even if you aren't all that ecstatic about the business world, i'm sure you will love the movie for all of its other qualities. The movie opens with a tilt, down from the trees into a park where we first meet the one of the main characters. Ben Whittaker, a seventy-year-old man who is struggling to find meaning in his life. Ben later comes across a flyer that explains an intern position for senior citizens. He wastes no time and applies for the job. After time goes by we meet the other lead role, Jules Ostin. She is a powerful business women that is 18 months into starting her own company. Ben gets one of the intern positions and is assigned to assist Jules with anything she needs. We soon learn that she is not the easiest person to work for. She is strong willed and believes she must do everything within the company to make sure it's done right. Nobody takes the time to get to know her accept for Ben. Throughout the rest of the movie we see their relationship transform. Not only do the characters develop a connection to one another, the audience finds a love for the characters as well. Robert De Niro does an amazing job playing the role of Ben. He has been seen in many movies but I have to say that his role in The Intern was very fitting. Ben's relationship with Jules makes for a heartwarming story with some comedy mixed in. The part of Jules has been questioned by some, it is common to feel that her character is putting a poor image on working moms. By the end of the film, Jules fixes this stereotype and establishes a better image for working moms. All around the actors who filled roles in this movie did an outstanding job. The connection and bond on and off the set was very clear, everyone casted in this movie worked very well together. Looking back over some of the movies highlights I found that the movie The Internship is very similar in many ways. Not just the name but the whole idea and process of the movie. They both have interns that are considered ""old"", the use of technology is very big in both, and both movies came out in very similar eras. With these two movies being so similar people may begin to compare them and rank one lower than the other. As The Intern came out 2 years after The Internship, Nancy Meyers ideas may not have been as original. Nancy Meyers and the director of The Internship, Shawn Levy, are both successful and have created two very popular films. Without giving away any spoilers, there are many surprises that cause the movie to change direction. These shifts are executed very well through the script as well as the actors cemotion. Once you fall in love with the characters you feel the pain and struggle they go through. Even Though there are many twists that have the audience questioning the future of the characters and the business, the ending leaves you very fulfilled. So many different aspects of this movie stand out to me as a strength. From the brilliant acting, to the great director, and the stunning quality of setting and costume. This movie is a must see! There is no doubt in my mind that I will be watching this movie again sometime in the near future. Overall I would consider the plot and story line of the movie to be one of the best I have seen. The popular film director, producer and screenwriter, Nancy Meyers did an amazing job with this movie. I hope you enjoy The Intern as much as I did.",,"0 out of 1 found this helpful.
